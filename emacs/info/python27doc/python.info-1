1.1 What’s New in Python 2.7
==============================

Author: A.M. Kuchling (amk at amk.ca)

This article explains the new features in Python 2.7.  Python 2.7 was
released on July 3, 2010.

Numeric handling has been improved in many ways, for both
floating-point numbers and for the *Note Decimal: 1b5. class.  There
are some useful additions to the standard library, such as a greatly
enhanced *Note unittest: 187. module, the *Note argparse: d. module for
parsing command-line options, convenient *Note OrderedDict: 1b6.  and
*Note Counter: 1b7. classes in the *Note collections: 65. module, and
many other improvements.

Python 2.7 is planned to be the last of the 2.x releases, so we worked
on making it a good release for the long term.  To help with porting to
Python 3, several new features from the Python 3.x series have been
included in 2.7.

This article doesn’t attempt to provide a complete specification of
the new features, but instead provides a convenient overview.  For full
details, you should refer to the documentation for Python 2.7 at
<https://docs.python.org>. If you want to understand the rationale for
the design and implementation, refer to the PEP for a particular new
feature or the issue on <https://bugs.python.org> in which a change was
discussed.  Whenever possible, “What’s New in Python” links to the

1.1.1 The Future for Python 2.x
-------------------------------

Python 2.7 is the last major release in the 2.x series, as the Python
maintainers have shifted the focus of their new feature development
efforts to the Python 3.x series. This means that while Python 2
continues to receive bug fixes, and to be updated to build correctly on
new hardware and versions of supported operated systems, there will be
no new full feature releases for the language or standard library.

However, while there is a large common subset between Python 2.7 and
Python 3, and many of the changes involved in migrating to that common
subset, or directly to Python 3, can be safely automated, some other
changes (notably those associated with Unicode handling) may require
careful consideration, and preferably robust automated regression test
suites, to migrate effectively.

This means that Python 2.7 will remain in place for a long time,
providing a stable and supported base platform for production systems
that have not yet been ported to Python 3. The full expected lifecycle
of the Python 2.7 series is detailed in PEP 373(1).

Some key consequences of the long-term significance of 2.7 are:

   * As noted above, the 2.7 release has a much longer period of
     maintenance when compared to earlier 2.x versions. Python 2.7 is
     currently expected to remain supported by the core development
     team (receiving security updates and other bug fixes) until at
     least 2020 (10 years after its initial release, compared to the
     more typical support period of 18–24 months).

   * As the Python 2.7 standard library ages, making effective use of
     the Python Package Index (either directly or via a redistributor)
     becomes more important for Python 2 users. In addition to a wide
     variety of third party packages for various tasks, the available
     packages include backports of new modules and features from the
     Python 3 standard library that are compatible with Python 2, as
     well as various tools and libraries that can make it easier to
     migrate to Python 3. The Python Packaging User Guide(2) provides
     guidance on downloading and installing software from the Python
     Package Index.

   * While the preferred approach to enhancing Python 2 is now the
     publication of new packages on the Python Package Index, this
     approach doesn’t necessarily work in all cases, especially those
     related to network security. In exceptional cases that cannot be
     handled adequately by publishing new or updated packages on PyPI,
     the Python Enhancement Proposal process may be used to make the
     case for adding new features directly to the Python 2 standard
     library. Any such additions, and the maintenance releases where
     they were added, will be noted in the *Note New Features Added to
     Python 2.7 Maintenance Releases: 1ba. section below.

For projects wishing to migrate from Python 2 to Python 3, or for
library and framework developers wishing to support users on both
Python 2 and Python 3, there are a variety of tools and guides
available to help decide on a suitable approach and manage some of the
technical details involved.  The recommended starting point is the
*Note Porting Python 2 Code to Python 3: 1bb. HOWTO guide.

1.1.2 Changes to the Handling of Deprecation Warnings
-----------------------------------------------------

For Python 2.7, a policy decision was made to silence warnings only of
interest to developers by default.  *Note DeprecationWarning: 1bd. and
its descendants are now ignored unless otherwise requested, preventing
users from seeing warnings triggered by an application.  This change
was also made in the branch that became Python 3.2. (Discussed on
stdlib-sig and carried out in issue 7319(1).)

In previous releases, *Note DeprecationWarning: 1bd. messages were
enabled by default, providing Python developers with a clear indication
of where their code may break in a future major version of Python.

However, there are increasingly many users of Python-based applications
who are not directly involved in the development of those applications.
*Note DeprecationWarning: 1bd. messages are irrelevant to such users,
making them worry about an application that’s actually working
correctly and burdening application developers with responding to these
concerns.

You can re-enable display of *Note DeprecationWarning: 1bd. messages by
running Python with the *Note -Wdefault: 1be. (short form: *Note -Wd:
1be.) switch, or by setting the *Note PYTHONWARNINGS: 1bf.  environment
variable to `"default"' (or `"d"') before running Python.  Python code
can also re-enable them by calling `warnings.simplefilter('default')'.

The `unittest' module also automatically reenables deprecation warnings
when running tests.

1.1.3 Python 3.1 Features
-------------------------

Much as Python 2.6 incorporated features from Python 3.0, version 2.7
incorporates some of the new features in Python 3.1.  The 2.x series
continues to provide tools for migrating to the 3.x series.

A partial list of 3.1 features that were backported to 2.7:

   * The syntax for set literals (`{1,2,3}' is a mutable set).

   * Dictionary and set comprehensions (`{i: i*2 for i in range(3)}').

   * Multiple context managers in a single *Note with: 1c1. statement.

   * A new version of the *Note io: fa. library, rewritten in C for
     performance.

   * The ordered-dictionary type described in *Note PEP 372; Adding an
     Ordered Dictionary to collections: 1c2.

   * The new `","' format specifier described in *Note PEP 378; Format
     Specifier for Thousands Separator: 1c3.

   * The *Note memoryview: 1c4. object.

   * A small subset of the *Note importlib: f7. module, *Note described
     below: 1c5.

   * The *Note repr(): 1c6. of a float `x' is shorter in many cases:
     it’s now based on the shortest decimal string that’s
     guaranteed to round back to `x'.  As in previous versions of
     Python, it’s guaranteed that `float(repr(x))' recovers `x'.

   * Float-to-string and string-to-float conversions are correctly
     rounded.  The *Note round(): 1c7. function is also now correctly
     rounded.

   * The *Note PyCapsule: 1c8. type, used to provide a C API for
     extension modules.

   * The *Note PyLong_AsLongAndOverflow(): 1c9. C API function.

Other new Python3-mode warnings include:

   * *Note operator.isCallable(): 1ca. and *Note
     operator.sequenceIncludes(): 1cb, which are not supported in 3.x,
     now trigger warnings.

   * The *Note -3: 1cc. switch now automatically enables the *Note
     -Qwarn: 1cd. switch that causes warnings about using classic
     division with integers and long integers.

1.1.4 PEP 372: Adding an Ordered Dictionary to collections
----------------------------------------------------------

Regular Python dictionaries iterate over key/value pairs in arbitrary
order.  Over the years, a number of authors have written alternative
implementations that remember the order that the keys were originally
inserted.  Based on the experiences from those implementations, 2.7
introduces a new *Note OrderedDict: 1b6. class in the *Note
collections: 65. module.

The *Note OrderedDict: 1b6. API provides the same interface as regular
dictionaries but iterates over keys and values in a guaranteed order
depending on when a key was first inserted:

    >>> from collections import OrderedDict
    >>> d = OrderedDict([('first', 1),
    ...                  ('second', 2),
    ...                  ('third', 3)])
    >>> d.items()
    [('first', 1), ('second', 2), ('third', 3)]

If a new entry overwrites an existing entry, the original insertion
position is left unchanged:

    >>> d['second'] = 4
    >>> d.items()
    [('first', 1), ('second', 4), ('third', 3)]

Deleting an entry and reinserting it will move it to the end:

    >>> del d['second']
    >>> d['second'] = 5
    >>> d.items()
    [('first', 1), ('third', 3), ('second', 5)]

The *Note popitem(): 1cf. method has an optional `last' argument that
defaults to `True'.  If `last' is true, the most recently added key is
returned and removed; if it’s false, the oldest key is selected:

    >>> od = OrderedDict([(x,0) for x in range(20)])
    >>> od.popitem()
    (19, 0)
    >>> od.popitem()
    (18, 0)
    >>> od.popitem(last=False)
    (0, 0)
    >>> od.popitem(last=False)
    (1, 0)

Comparing two ordered dictionaries checks both the keys and values, and
requires that the insertion order was the same:

    >>> od1 = OrderedDict([('first', 1),
    ...                    ('second', 2),
    ...                    ('third', 3)])
    >>> od2 = OrderedDict([('third', 3),
    ...                    ('first', 1),
    ...                    ('second', 2)])
    >>> od1 == od2
    False
    >>> # Move 'third' key to the end
    >>> del od2['third']; od2['third'] = 3
    >>> od1 == od2
    True

Comparing an *Note OrderedDict: 1b6. with a regular dictionary ignores
the insertion order and just compares the keys and values.

How does the *Note OrderedDict: 1b6. work?  It maintains a
doubly-linked list of keys, appending new keys to the list as they’re
inserted.  A secondary dictionary maps keys to their corresponding list
node, so deletion doesn’t have to traverse the entire linked list and
therefore remains O(1).

The standard library now supports use of ordered dictionaries in several
modules.

   * The *Note ConfigParser: 6d. module uses them by default, meaning
     that configuration files can now be read, modified, and then
     written back in their original order.

   * The *Note _asdict(): 1d0. method for *Note
     collections.namedtuple(): 1d1. now returns an ordered dictionary
     with the values appearing in the same order as the underlying
     tuple indices.

   * The *Note json: fd. module’s *Note JSONDecoder: 1d2. class
     constructor was extended with an `object_pairs_hook' parameter to
     allow `OrderedDict' instances to be built by the decoder.  Support
     was also added for third-party tools like PyYAML(1).

1.1.5 PEP 378: Format Specifier for Thousands Separator
-------------------------------------------------------

To make program output more readable, it can be useful to add
separators to large numbers, rendering them as
18,446,744,073,709,551,616 instead of 18446744073709551616.

The fully general solution for doing this is the *Note locale: 101.
module, which can use different separators (“,” in North America,
“.” in Europe) and different grouping sizes, but *Note locale: 101.
is complicated to use and unsuitable for multi-threaded applications
where different threads are producing output for different locales.

Therefore, a simple comma-grouping mechanism has been added to the
mini-language used by the *Note str.format(): 1d4. method.  When
formatting a floating-point number, simply include a comma between the
width and the precision:

    >>> '{:20,.2f}'.format(18446744073709551616.0)
    '18,446,744,073,709,551,616.00'

When formatting an integer, include the comma after the width:

    >>> '{:20,d}'.format(18446744073709551616)
    '18,446,744,073,709,551,616'

This mechanism is not adaptable at all; commas are always used as the
separator and the grouping is always into three-digit groups.  The
comma-formatting mechanism isn’t as general as the *Note locale: 101.
module, but it’s easier to use.

1.1.6 PEP 389: The argparse Module for Parsing Command Lines
------------------------------------------------------------

The *Note argparse: d. module for parsing command-line arguments was
added as a more powerful replacement for the *Note optparse: 128.
module.

This means Python now supports three different modules for parsing
command-line arguments: *Note getopt: df, *Note optparse: 128, and
*Note argparse: d.  The *Note getopt: df. module closely resembles the C
library’s `getopt()' function, so it remains useful if you’re
writing a Python prototype that will eventually be rewritten in C.
*Note optparse: 128. becomes redundant, but there are no plans to
remove it because there are many scripts still using it, and there’s
no automated way to update these scripts.  (Making the *Note argparse:
d.  API consistent with *Note optparse: 128.’s interface was
discussed but rejected as too messy and difficult.)

In short, if you’re writing a new script and don’t need to worry
about compatibility with earlier versions of Python, use *Note
argparse: d. instead of *Note optparse: 128.

Here’s an example:

    import argparse

    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Command-line example.')

    # Add optional switches
    parser.add_argument('-v', action='store_true', dest='is_verbose',
                        help='produce verbose output')
    parser.add_argument('-o', action='store', dest='output',
                        metavar='FILE',
                        help='direct output to FILE instead of stdout')
    parser.add_argument('-C', action='store', type=int, dest='context',
                        metavar='NUM', default=0,
                        help='display NUM lines of added context')

    # Allow any number of additional arguments.
    parser.add_argument(nargs='*', action='store', dest='inputs',
                        help='input filenames (default is stdin)')

    args = parser.parse_args()
    print args.__dict__

Unless you override it, `-h' and `--help' switches are automatically
added, and produce neatly formatted output:

    -> ./python.exe argparse-example.py --help
    usage: argparse-example.py [-h] [-v] [-o FILE] [-C NUM] [inputs [inputs ...]]

    Command-line example.

    positional arguments:
      inputs      input filenames (default is stdin)

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help  show this help message and exit
      -v          produce verbose output
      -o FILE     direct output to FILE instead of stdout
      -C NUM      display NUM lines of added context

As with *Note optparse: 128, the command-line switches and arguments
are returned as an object with attributes named by the `dest'
parameters:

    -> ./python.exe argparse-example.py -v
    {'output': None,
     'is_verbose': True,
     'context': 0,
     'inputs': []}

    -> ./python.exe argparse-example.py -v -o /tmp/output -C 4 file1 file2
    {'output': '/tmp/output',
     'is_verbose': True,
     'context': 4,
     'inputs': ['file1', 'file2']}

*Note argparse: d. has much fancier validation than *Note optparse:
128.; you can specify an exact number of arguments as an integer, 0 or
more arguments by passing `'*'', 1 or more by passing `'+'', or an
optional argument with `'?''.  A top-level parser can contain
sub-parsers to define subcommands that have different sets of switches,
as in `svn commit', `svn checkout', etc.  You can specify an
argument’s type as *Note FileType: 1d6, which will automatically open
files for you and understands that `'-'' means standard input or output.

1.1.7 PEP 391: Dictionary-Based Configuration For Logging
---------------------------------------------------------

The *Note logging: 102. module is very flexible; applications can define
a tree of logging subsystems, and each logger in this tree can filter
out certain messages, format them differently, and direct messages to a
varying number of handlers.

All this flexibility can require a lot of configuration.  You can write
Python statements to create objects and set their properties, but a
complex set-up requires verbose but boring code.  *Note logging: 102.
also supports a `fileConfig()' function that parses a file, but the
file format doesn’t support configuring filters, and it’s messier
to generate programmatically.

Python 2.7 adds a `dictConfig()' function that uses a dictionary to
configure logging.  There are many ways to produce a dictionary from
different sources: construct one with code; parse a file containing
JSON; or use a YAML parsing library if one is installed.  For more
information see *Note Configuration functions: 1d9.

The following example configures two loggers, the root logger and a
logger named “network”.  Messages sent to the root logger will be
sent to the system log using the syslog protocol, and messages to the
“network” logger will be written to a `network.log' file that will
be rotated once the log reaches 1MB.

    import logging
    import logging.config

    configdict = {
     'version': 1,    # Configuration schema in use; must be 1 for now
     'formatters': {
         'standard': {
             'format': ('%(asctime)s %(name)-15s '

                 'network': {

    # Set up configuration
    logging.config.dictConfig(configdict)

    # As an example, log two error messages
    logger = logging.getLogger('/')
    logger.error('Database not found')

    netlogger = logging.getLogger('network')
    netlogger.error('Connection failed')

Three smaller enhancements to the *Note logging: 102. module, all
implemented by Vinay Sajip, are:

   * The *Note SysLogHandler: 1da. class now supports syslogging over
     TCP.  The constructor has a `socktype' parameter giving the type
     of socket to use, either *Note socket.SOCK_DGRAM: 1db.  for UDP or
     *Note socket.SOCK_STREAM: 1dc. for TCP.  The default protocol
     remains UDP.

   * *Note Logger: 1dd. instances gained a *Note getChild(): 1de.
     method that retrieves a descendant logger using a relative path.
     For example, once you retrieve a logger by doing `log =
     getLogger('app')', calling `log.getChild('network.listen')' is
     equivalent to `getLogger('app.network.listen')'.

   * The *Note LoggerAdapter: 1df. class gained an `isEnabledFor()'
     method that takes a `level' and returns whether the underlying
     logger would process a message of that level of importance.

1.1.8 PEP 3106: Dictionary Views
--------------------------------

The dictionary methods *Note keys(): 1e1, *Note values(): 1e2, and
*Note items(): 1e3. are different in Python 3.x.  They return an object
called a `view' instead of a fully materialized list.

It’s not possible to change the return values of *Note keys(): 1e1,
*Note values(): 1e2, and *Note items(): 1e3. in Python 2.7 because too
much code would break.  Instead the 3.x versions were added under the
new names *Note viewkeys(): 1e4, *Note viewvalues(): 1e5, and *Note
viewitems(): 1e6.

    >>> d = dict((i*10, chr(65+i)) for i in range(26))
    >>> d
    {0: 'A', 130: 'N', 10: 'B', 140: 'O', 20: ..., 250: 'Z'}
    >>> d.viewkeys()
    dict_keys([0, 130, 10, 140, 20, 150, 30, ..., 250])

Views can be iterated over, but the key and item views also behave like
sets.  The `&' operator performs intersection, and `|' performs a union:

    >>> d1 = dict((i*10, chr(65+i)) for i in range(26))
    >>> d2 = dict((i**.5, i) for i in range(1000))
    >>> d1.viewkeys() & d2.viewkeys()
    set([0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 30.0])
    >>> d1.viewkeys() | range(0, 30)
    set([0, 1, 130, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..., 120, 250])

The view keeps track of the dictionary and its contents change as the
dictionary is modified:

    >>> vk = d.viewkeys()
    >>> vk
    dict_keys([0, 130, 10, ..., 250])
    >>> d[260] = '&'
    >>> vk
    dict_keys([0, 130, 260, 10, ..., 250])

However, note that you can’t add or remove keys while you’re
iterating over the view:

    >>> for k in vk:
    ...     d[k*2] = k
    ...
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration

You can use the view methods in Python 2.x code, and the 2to3 converter
will change them to the standard *Note keys(): 1e1, *Note values():
1e2, and *Note items(): 1e3. methods.

1.1.9 PEP 3137: The memoryview Object
-------------------------------------

The *Note memoryview: 1c4. object provides a view of another object’s
memory content that matches the `bytes' type’s interface.

    >>> import string
    >>> m = memoryview(string.letters)
    >>> m
    <memory at 0x37f850>
    >>> len(m)           # Returns length of underlying object
    52
    >>> m[0], m[25], m[26]   # Indexing returns one byte
    ('a', 'z', 'A')
    >>> m2 = m[0:26]         # Slicing returns another memoryview
    >>> m2
    <memory at 0x37f080>

The content of the view can be converted to a string of bytes or a list
of integers:

    >>> m2.tobytes()
    'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    >>> m2.tolist()
    [97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, ... 121, 122]
    >>>

*Note memoryview: 1c4. objects allow modifying the underlying object if
it’s a mutable object.

    >>> m2[0] = 75
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: cannot modify read-only memory
    >>> b = bytearray(string.letters)  # Creating a mutable object
    >>> b
    bytearray(b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ')
    >>> mb = memoryview(b)
    >>> mb[0] = '*'         # Assign to view, changing the bytearray.
    >>> b[0:5]              # The bytearray has been changed.
    bytearray(b'*bcde')
    >>>

1.1.10 Other Language Changes
-----------------------------

Some smaller changes made to the core Python language are:

   * The syntax for set literals has been backported from Python 3.x.
     Curly brackets are used to surround the contents of the resulting
     mutable set; set literals are distinguished from dictionaries by
     not containing colons and values.  `{}' continues to represent an
     empty dictionary; use `set()' for an empty set.

         >>> {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
         set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
         >>> set() # empty set
         set([])
         >>> {}    # empty dict
         {}

     Backported by Alexandre Vassalotti; issue 2335(1).

   * Dictionary and set comprehensions are another feature backported
     from 3.x, generalizing list/generator comprehensions to use the
     literal syntax for sets and dictionaries.

         >>> {x: x*x for x in range(6)}
         {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}
         >>> {('a'*x) for x in range(6)}
         set(['', 'a', 'aa', 'aaa', 'aaaa', 'aaaaa'])

     Backported by Alexandre Vassalotti; issue 2333(2).

   * The *Note with: 1c1. statement can now use multiple context
     managers in one statement.  Context managers are processed from
     left to right and each one is treated as beginning a new *Note
     with: 1c1. statement.  This means that:

         with A() as a, B() as b:
             ... suite of statements ...

     is equivalent to:

         with A() as a:
             with B() as b:
                 ... suite of statements ...

     The *Note contextlib.nested(): 1e9. function provides a very
     similar function, so it’s no longer necessary and has been
     deprecated.

     (Proposed in <https://codereview.appspot.com/53094>; implemented by
     Georg Brandl.)

   * Conversions between floating-point numbers and strings are now
     correctly rounded on most platforms.  These conversions occur in
     many different places: *Note str(): 1ea. on floats and complex
     numbers; the *Note float: 1eb. and *Note complex: 1ec.
     constructors; numeric formatting; serializing and deserializing
     floats and complex numbers using the *Note marshal: 10c, *Note
     pickle: 12e.  and *Note json: fd. modules; parsing of float and
     imaginary literals in Python code; and *Note Decimal:
     1b5.-to-float conversion.

     Related to this, the *Note repr(): 1c6. of a floating-point number
     `x' now returns a result based on the shortest decimal string
     that’s guaranteed to round back to `x' under correct rounding
     (with round-half-to-even rounding mode).  Previously it gave a
     string based on rounding x to 17 decimal digits.

     The rounding library responsible for this improvement works on
     Windows and on Unix platforms using the gcc, icc, or suncc
     compilers.  There may be a small number of platforms where correct
     operation of this code cannot be guaranteed, so the code is not
     used on such systems.  You can find out which code is being used
     by checking *Note sys.float_repr_style: 1ed,  which will be `short'
     if the new code is in use and `legacy' if it isn’t.

     Implemented by Eric Smith and Mark Dickinson, using David Gay’s
     `dtoa.c' library; issue 7117(3).

   * Conversions from long integers and regular integers to floating
     point now round differently, returning the floating-point number
     closest to the number.  This doesn’t matter for small integers
     that can be converted exactly, but for large numbers that will
     unavoidably lose precision, Python 2.7 now approximates more
     closely.  For example, Python 2.6 computed the following:

         >>> n = 295147905179352891391
         >>> float(n)
         2.9514790517935283e+20
         >>> n - long(float(n))
         65535L

     Python 2.7’s floating-point result is larger, but much closer to
     the true value:

         >>> n = 295147905179352891391
         >>> float(n)
         2.9514790517935289e+20
         >>> n - long(float(n))
         -1L

     (Implemented by Mark Dickinson; issue 3166(4).)

     Integer division is also more accurate in its rounding behaviours.
     (Also implemented by Mark Dickinson; issue 1811(5).)

   * Implicit coercion for complex numbers has been removed; the
     interpreter will no longer ever attempt to call a *Note
     __coerce__(): 1ee. method on complex objects.  (Removed by Meador
     Inge and Mark Dickinson; issue 5211(6).)

   * The *Note str.format(): 1d4. method now supports automatic
     numbering of the replacement fields.  This makes using *Note
     str.format(): 1d4. more closely resemble using `%s' formatting:

         >>> '{}:{}:{}'.format(2009, 04, 'Sunday')
         '2009:4:Sunday'
         >>> '{}:{}:{day}'.format(2009, 4, day='Sunday')
         '2009:4:Sunday'

     The auto-numbering takes the fields from left to right, so the
     first `{...}' specifier will use the first argument to *Note
     str.format(): 1d4, the next specifier will use the next argument,
     and so on.  You can’t mix auto-numbering and explicit numbering
     – either number all of your specifier fields or none of them –
     but you can mix auto-numbering and named fields, as in the second
     example above.  (Contributed by Eric Smith; issue 5237(7).)

     Complex numbers now correctly support usage with *Note format():
     1ef, and default to being right-aligned.  Specifying a precision
     or comma-separation applies to both the real and imaginary parts
     of the number, but a specified field width and alignment is
     applied to the whole of the resulting `1.5+3j' output.
     (Contributed by Eric Smith; issue 1588(8) and issue 7988(9).)

     The ‘F’ format code now always formats its output using
     uppercase characters, so it will now produce ‘INF’ and
     ‘NAN’.  (Contributed by Eric Smith; issue 3382(10).)

     A low-level change: the `object.__format__()' method now triggers
     a *Note PendingDeprecationWarning: 1f0. if it’s passed a format
     string, because the `__format__()' method for *Note object: 1f1.
     converts the object to a string representation and formats that.
     Previously the method silently applied the format string to the
     string representation, but that could hide mistakes in Python
     code.  If you’re supplying formatting information such as an
     alignment or precision, presumably you’re expecting the
     formatting to be applied in some object-specific way.  (Fixed by
     Eric Smith; issue 7994(11).)

   * The *Note int(): 1f2. and *Note long(): 1f3. types gained a
     `bit_length' method that returns the number of bits necessary to
     represent its argument in binary:

         >>> n = 37
         >>> bin(n)
         '0b100101'
         >>> n.bit_length()
         6
         >>> n = 2**123-1
         >>> n.bit_length()
         123
         >>> (n+1).bit_length()
         124

     (Contributed by Fredrik Johansson and Victor Stinner; issue
     3439(12).)

   * The *Note import: 1f4. statement will no longer try an absolute
     import if a relative import (e.g. `from .os import sep') fails.
     This fixes a bug, but could possibly break certain *Note import:
     1f4.  statements that were only working by accident.  (Fixed by
     Meador Inge; issue 7902(13).)

   * It’s now possible for a subclass of the built-in *Note unicode:
     1f5. type to override the *Note __unicode__(): 1f6. method.
     (Implemented by Victor Stinner; issue 1583863(14).)

   * The *Note bytearray: 1f7. type’s `translate()' method now accepts
     `None' as its first argument.  (Fixed by Georg Brandl; issue
     4759(15).)

   * When using `@classmethod' and `@staticmethod' to wrap methods as
     class or static methods, the wrapper object now exposes the
     wrapped function as their `__func__' attribute.  (Contributed by
     Amaury Forgeot d’Arc, after a suggestion by George Sakkis; issue
     5982(16).)

   * When a restricted set of attributes were set using `__slots__',
     deleting an unset attribute would not raise *Note AttributeError:
     1f8.  as you would expect.  Fixed by Benjamin Peterson; issue
     7604(17).)

   * Two new encodings are now supported: “cp720”, used primarily
     for Arabic text; and “cp858”, a variant of CP 850 that adds
     the euro symbol.  (CP720 contributed by Alexander Belchenko and
     Amaury Forgeot d’Arc in issue 1616979(18); CP858 contributed by
     Tim Hatch in issue 8016(19).)

   * The *Note file: 1f9. object will now set the `filename' attribute
     on the *Note IOError: 1fa. exception when trying to open a
     directory on POSIX platforms (noted by Jan Kaliszewski; issue
     4764(20)), and now explicitly checks for and forbids writing to
     read-only file objects instead of trusting the C library to catch
     and report the error (fixed by Stefan Krah; issue 5677(21)).

   * The Python tokenizer now translates line endings itself, so the
     *Note compile(): 1fb. built-in function now accepts code using any
     line-ending convention.  Additionally, it no longer requires that
     the code end in a newline.

   * Extra parentheses in function definitions are illegal in Python
     3.x, meaning that you get a syntax error from `def f((x)): pass'.
     In Python3-warning mode, Python 2.7 will now warn about this odd
     usage.  (Noted by James Lingard; issue 7362(22).)

   * It’s now possible to create weak references to old-style class
     objects.  New-style classes were always weak-referenceable.  (Fixed
     by Antoine Pitrou; issue 8268(23).)

   * When a module object is garbage-collected, the module’s
     dictionary is now only cleared if no one else is holding a
     reference to the dictionary (issue 7140(24)).

1.1.10.1 Interpreter Changes
............................

A new environment variable, *Note PYTHONWARNINGS: 1bf, allows
controlling warnings.  It should be set to a string containing warning
settings, equivalent to those used with the *Note -W: 1be. switch,
separated by commas.  (Contributed by Brian Curtin; issue 7301(1).)

For example, the following setting will print warnings every time they
occur, but turn warnings from the *Note Cookie: 6f. module into an
error.  (The exact syntax for setting an environment variable varies
across operating systems and shells.)

    export PYTHONWARNINGS=all,error:::Cookie:0

1.1.10.2 Optimizations
......................

Several performance enhancements have been added:

   * A new opcode was added to perform the initial setup for *Note
     with: 1c1. statements, looking up the *Note __enter__(): 1ff. and
     *Note __exit__(): 200. methods.  (Contributed by Benjamin
     Peterson.)

   * The garbage collector now performs better for one common usage
     pattern: when many objects are being allocated without deallocating
     any of them.  This would previously take quadratic time for
     garbage collection, but now the number of full garbage collections
     is reduced as the number of objects on the heap grows.  The new
     logic only performs a full garbage collection pass when the middle
     generation has been collected 10 times and when the number of
     survivor objects from the middle generation exceeds 10% of the
     number of objects in the oldest generation.  (Suggested by Martin
     von Löwis and implemented by Antoine Pitrou; issue 4074(1).)

   * The garbage collector tries to avoid tracking simple containers
     which can’t be part of a cycle. In Python 2.7, this is now true
     for tuples and dicts containing atomic types (such as ints,
     strings, etc.). Transitively, a dict containing tuples of atomic
     types won’t be tracked either. This helps reduce the cost of each
     garbage collection by decreasing the number of objects to be
     considered and traversed by the collector.  (Contributed by
     Antoine Pitrou; issue 4688(2).)

   * Long integers are now stored internally either in base 2**15 or in
     base 2**30, the base being determined at build time.  Previously,
     they were always stored in base 2**15.  Using base 2**30 gives
     significant performance improvements on 64-bit machines, but
     benchmark results on 32-bit machines have been mixed.  Therefore,
     the default is to use base 2**30 on 64-bit machines and base 2**15
     on 32-bit machines; on Unix, there’s a new configure option
     `--enable-big-digits' that can be used to override this default.

     Apart from the performance improvements this change should be
     invisible to end users, with one exception: for testing and
     debugging purposes there’s a new structseq *Note sys.long_info:
     201. that provides information about the internal format, giving
     the number of bits per digit and the size in bytes of the C type
     used to store each digit:

         >>> import sys
         >>> sys.long_info
         sys.long_info(bits_per_digit=30, sizeof_digit=4)

     (Contributed by Mark Dickinson; issue 4258(3).)

     Another set of changes made long objects a few bytes smaller: 2
     bytes smaller on 32-bit systems and 6 bytes on 64-bit.
     (Contributed by Mark Dickinson; issue 5260(4).)

   * The division algorithm for long integers has been made faster by
     tightening the inner loop, doing shifts instead of multiplications,
     and fixing an unnecessary extra iteration.  Various benchmarks
     show speedups of between 50% and 150% for long integer divisions
     and modulo operations.  (Contributed by Mark Dickinson; issue
     5512(5).)  Bitwise operations are also significantly faster
     (initial patch by Gregory Smith; issue 1087418(6)).

   * The implementation of `%' checks for the left-side operand being a
     Python string and special-cases it; this results in a 1–3%
     performance increase for applications that frequently use `%' with
     strings, such as templating libraries.  (Implemented by Collin
     Winter; issue 5176(7).)

   * List comprehensions with an `if' condition are compiled into
     faster bytecode.  (Patch by Antoine Pitrou, back-ported to 2.7 by
     Jeffrey Yasskin; issue 4715(8).)

   * Converting an integer or long integer to a decimal string was made
     faster by special-casing base 10 instead of using a generalized
     conversion function that supports arbitrary bases.  (Patch by
     Gawain Bolton; issue 6713(9).)

   * The `split()', `replace()', `rindex()', `rpartition()', and
     `rsplit()' methods of string-like types (strings, Unicode strings,
     and *Note bytearray: 1f7. objects) now use a fast reverse-search
     algorithm instead of a character-by-character scan.  This is
     sometimes faster by a factor of 10.  (Added by Florent Xicluna;
     issue 7462(10) and issue 7622(11).)

   * The *Note pickle: 12e. and *Note cPickle: 73. modules now
     automatically intern the strings used for attribute names,
     reducing memory usage of the objects resulting from unpickling.
     (Contributed by Jake McGuire; issue 5084(12).)

   * The *Note cPickle: 73. module now special-cases dictionaries,
     nearly halving the time required to pickle them.  (Contributed by
     Collin Winter; issue 5670(13).)

1.1.11 New and Improved Modules
-------------------------------

As in every release, Python’s standard library received a number of
enhancements and bug fixes.  Here’s a partial list of the most notable
changes, sorted alphabetically by module name. Consult the `Misc/NEWS'
file in the source tree for a more complete list of changes, or look
through the Subversion logs for all the details.

   * The *Note bdb: 18. module’s base debugging class *Note Bdb: 203.
     gained a feature for skipping modules.  The constructor now takes
     an iterable containing glob-style patterns such as `django.*'; the
     debugger will not step into stack frames from a module that
     matches one of these patterns.  (Contributed by Maru Newby after a
     suggestion by Senthil Kumaran; issue 5142(1).)

   * The *Note binascii: 19. module now supports the buffer API, so it
     can be used with *Note memoryview: 1c4. instances and other
     similar buffer objects.  (Backported from 3.x by Florent Xicluna;
     issue 7703(2).)

   * Updated module: the *Note bsddb: 1c. module has been updated from
     4.7.2devel9 to version 4.8.4 of the pybsddb package(3).  The new
     version features better Python 3.x compatibility, various bug
     fixes, and adds several new BerkeleyDB flags and methods.
     (Updated by Jesús Cea Avión; issue 8156(4).  The pybsddb
     changelog can be read at
     <http://hg.jcea.es/pybsddb/file/tip/ChangeLog>.)

   * The *Note bz2: 1e. module’s *Note BZ2File: 204. now supports the
     context management protocol, so you can write `with
     bz2.BZ2File(...) as f:'.  (Contributed by Hagen Fürstenau; issue
     3860(5).)

   * New class: the *Note Counter: 1b7. class in the *Note collections:
     65.  module is useful for tallying data.  *Note Counter: 1b7.
     instances behave mostly like dictionaries but return zero for
     missing keys instead of raising a *Note KeyError: 205.:

         >>> from collections import Counter
         >>> c = Counter()
         >>> for letter in 'here is a sample of english text':
         ...   c[letter] += 1
         ...
         >>> c
         Counter({' ': 6, 'e': 5, 's': 3, 'a': 2, 'i': 2, 'h': 2,
         'l': 2, 't': 2, 'g': 1, 'f': 1, 'm': 1, 'o': 1, 'n': 1,
         'p': 1, 'r': 1, 'x': 1})
         >>> c['e']
         5
         >>> c['z']
         0

     There are three additional *Note Counter: 1b7. methods.  *Note
     most_common(): 206. returns the N most common elements and their
     counts.  *Note elements(): 207.  returns an iterator over the
     contained elements, repeating each element as many times as its
     count.  *Note subtract(): 208. takes an iterable and subtracts one
     for each element instead of adding; if the argument is a
     dictionary or another `Counter', the counts are subtracted.

         >>> c.most_common(5)
         [(' ', 6), ('e', 5), ('s', 3), ('a', 2), ('i', 2)]
         >>> c.elements() ->
            'a', 'a', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ',
            'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'g', 'f', 'i', 'i',
            'h', 'h', 'm', 'l', 'l', 'o', 'n', 'p', 's',
            's', 's', 'r', 't', 't', 'x'
         >>> c['e']
         5
         >>> c.subtract('very heavy on the letter e')
         >>> c['e']    # Count is now lower
         -1

     Contributed by Raymond Hettinger; issue 1696199(6).

     New class: *Note OrderedDict: 1b6. is described in the earlier
     section *Note PEP 372; Adding an Ordered Dictionary to
     collections: 1c2.

     New method: The *Note deque: 209. data type now has a *Note
     count(): 20a. method that returns the number of contained elements
     equal to the supplied argument `x', and a *Note reverse(): 20b.
     method that reverses the elements of the deque in-place.  *Note
     deque: 209. also exposes its maximum length as the read-only *Note
     maxlen: 20c. attribute.  (Both features added by Raymond
     Hettinger.)

     The *Note namedtuple: 1d1. class now has an optional `rename'
     parameter.  If `rename' is true, field names that are invalid
     because they’ve been repeated or aren’t legal Python
     identifiers will be renamed to legal names that are derived from
     the field’s position within the list of fields:

         >>> from collections import namedtuple
         >>> T = namedtuple('T', ['field1', '$illegal', 'for', 'field2'], rename=True)
         >>> T._fields
         ('field1', '_1', '_2', 'field2')

     (Added by Raymond Hettinger; issue 1818(7).)

     Finally, the *Note Mapping: 20d. abstract base class now returns
     *Note NotImplemented: 20e. if a mapping is compared to another
     type that isn’t a `Mapping'.  (Fixed by Daniel Stutzbach; issue
     8729(8).)

   * Constructors for the parsing classes in the *Note ConfigParser:
     6d. module now take an `allow_no_value' parameter, defaulting to
     false; if true, options without values will be allowed.  For
     example:

         >>> import ConfigParser, StringIO
         >>> sample_config = """
         ... [mysqld]
         ... user = mysql
         ... pid-file = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
         ... skip-bdb
         ... """
         >>> config = ConfigParser.RawConfigParser(allow_no_value=True)
         >>> config.readfp(StringIO.StringIO(sample_config))
         >>> config.get('mysqld', 'user')
         'mysql'
         >>> print config.get('mysqld', 'skip-bdb')
         None
         >>> print config.get('mysqld', 'unknown')
         Traceback (most recent call last):
           ...
         NoOptionError: No option 'unknown' in section: 'mysqld'

     (Contributed by Mats Kindahl; issue 7005(9).)

   * Deprecated function: *Note contextlib.nested(): 1e9, which allows
     handling more than one context manager with a single *Note with:
     1c1.  statement, has been deprecated, because the *Note with: 1c1.
     statement now supports multiple context managers.

   * The *Note cookielib: 70. module now ignores cookies that have an
     invalid version field, one that doesn’t contain an integer
     value.  (Fixed by John J. Lee; issue 3924(10).)

   * The *Note copy: 71. module’s *Note deepcopy(): 20f. function
     will now correctly copy bound instance methods.  (Implemented by
     Robert Collins; issue 1515(11).)

   * The *Note ctypes: 78. module now always converts `None' to a C NULL
     pointer for arguments declared as pointers.  (Changed by Thomas
     Heller; issue 4606(12).)  The underlying libffi library(13) has
     been updated to version 3.0.9, containing various fixes for
     different platforms.  (Updated by Matthias Klose; issue 8142(14).)

   * New method: the *Note datetime: 7d. module’s *Note timedelta:
     210. class gained a *Note total_seconds(): 211. method that
     returns the number of seconds in the duration.  (Contributed by
     Brian Quinlan; issue 5788(15).)

   * New method: the *Note Decimal: 1b5. class gained a *Note
     from_float(): 212. class method that performs an exact conversion
     of a floating-point number to a *Note Decimal: 1b5.  This exact
     conversion strives for the closest decimal approximation to the
     floating-point representation’s value; the resulting decimal
     value will therefore still include the inaccuracy, if any.  For
     example, `Decimal.from_float(0.1)' returns
     `Decimal('0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625')'.
     (Implemented by Raymond Hettinger; issue 4796(16).)

     Comparing instances of *Note Decimal: 1b5. with floating-point
     numbers now produces sensible results based on the numeric values
     of the operands.  Previously such comparisons would fall back to
     Python’s default rules for comparing objects, which produced
     arbitrary results based on their type.  Note that you still cannot
     combine `Decimal' and floating-point in other operations such as
     addition, since you should be explicitly choosing how to convert
     between float and *Note Decimal: 1b5.  (Fixed by Mark Dickinson;
     issue 2531(17).)

     The constructor for *Note Decimal: 1b5. now accepts floating-point
     numbers (added by Raymond Hettinger; issue 8257(18)) and
     non-European Unicode characters such as Arabic-Indic digits
     (contributed by Mark Dickinson; issue 6595(19)).

     Most of the methods of the *Note Context: 213. class now accept
     integers as well as *Note Decimal: 1b5. instances; the only
     exceptions are the *Note canonical(): 214. and *Note
     is_canonical(): 215.  methods.  (Patch by Juan José Conti; issue
     7633(20).)

     When using *Note Decimal: 1b5. instances with a string’s *Note
     format(): 1d4. method, the default alignment was previously
     left-alignment.  This has been changed to right-alignment, which is
     more sensible for numeric types.  (Changed by Mark Dickinson;
     issue 6857(21).)

     Comparisons involving a signaling NaN value (or `sNAN') now signal
     `InvalidOperation' instead of silently returning a true or false
     value depending on the comparison operator.  Quiet NaN values (or
     `NaN') are now hashable.  (Fixed by Mark Dickinson; issue
     7279(22).)

   * The *Note difflib: 82. module now produces output that is more
     compatible with modern `diff'/`patch' tools through one small
     change, using a tab character instead of spaces as a separator in
     the header giving the filename.  (Fixed by Anatoly Techtonik;
     issue 7585(23).)

   * The Distutils `sdist' command now always regenerates the
     `MANIFEST' file, since even if the `MANIFEST.in' or `setup.py'
     files haven’t been modified, the user might have created some
     new files that should be included.  (Fixed by Tarek Ziadé; issue
     8688(24).)

   * The *Note doctest: b5. module’s `IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL' flag
     will now ignore the name of the module containing the exception
     being tested.  (Patch by Lennart Regebro; issue 7490(25).)

   * The *Note email: bb. module’s *Note Message: 216. class will now
     accept a Unicode-valued payload, automatically converting the
     payload to the encoding specified by `output_charset'.  (Added by
     R. David Murray; issue 1368247(26).)

   * The *Note Fraction: 217. class now accepts a single float or *Note
     Decimal: 1b5. instance, or two rational numbers, as arguments to
     its constructor.  (Implemented by Mark Dickinson; rationals added
     in issue 5812(27), and float/decimal in issue 8294(28).)

     Ordering comparisons (`<', `<=', `>', `>=') between fractions and
     complex numbers now raise a *Note TypeError: 218.  This fixes an
     oversight, making the *Note Fraction: 217.  match the other
     numeric types.

   * New class: *Note FTP_TLS: 219. in the *Note ftplib: d9. module
     provides secure FTP connections using TLS encapsulation of
     authentication as well as subsequent control and data transfers.
     (Contributed by Giampaolo Rodola; issue 2054(29).)

     The *Note storbinary(): 21a. method for binary uploads can now
     restart uploads thanks to an added `rest' parameter (patch by
     Pablo Mouzo; issue 6845(30).)

   * New class decorator: *Note total_ordering(): 21b. in the *Note
     functools: da.  module takes a class that defines an *Note
     __eq__(): 21c. method and one of *Note __lt__(): 21d, *Note
     __le__(): 21e, *Note __gt__(): 21f, or *Note __ge__(): 220, and
     generates the missing comparison methods.  Since the *Note
     __cmp__(): 221. method is being deprecated in Python 3.x, this
     decorator makes it easier to define ordered classes.  (Added by
     Raymond Hettinger; issue 5479(31).)

     New function: *Note cmp_to_key(): 222. will take an old-style
     comparison function that expects two arguments and return a new
     callable that can be used as the `key' parameter to functions such
     as *Note sorted(): 223, *Note min(): 224. and *Note max(): 225,
     etc.  The primary intended use is to help with making code
     compatible with Python 3.x.  (Added by Raymond Hettinger.)

   * New function: the *Note gc: dc. module’s *Note is_tracked():
     226. returns true if a given instance is tracked by the garbage
     collector, false otherwise. (Contributed by Antoine Pitrou; issue
     4688(32).)

   * The *Note gzip: e6. module’s *Note GzipFile: 227. now supports
     the context management protocol, so you can write `with
     gzip.GzipFile(...) as f:' (contributed by Hagen Fürstenau; issue
     3860(33)), and it now implements the *Note io.BufferedIOBase: 228.
     ABC, so you can wrap it with *Note io.BufferedReader: 229. for
     faster processing (contributed by Nir Aides; issue 7471(34)).
     It’s also now possible to override the modification time
     recorded in a gzipped file by providing an optional timestamp to
     the constructor.  (Contributed by Jacques Frechet; issue 4272(35).)

     Files in gzip format can be padded with trailing zero bytes; the
     *Note gzip: e6. module will now consume these trailing bytes.
     (Fixed by Tadek Pietraszek and Brian Curtin; issue 2846(36).)

   * New attribute: the *Note hashlib: e7. module now has an *Note
     algorithms: 22a.  attribute containing a tuple naming the
     supported algorithms.  In Python 2.7, `hashlib.algorithms' contains
     `('md5', 'sha1', 'sha224', 'sha256', 'sha384', 'sha512')'.
     (Contributed by Carl Chenet; issue 7418(37).)

   * The default *Note HTTPResponse: 22b. class used by the *Note
     httplib: ef. module now supports buffering, resulting in much
     faster reading of HTTP responses.  (Contributed by Kristján Valur
     Jónsson; issue 4879(38).)

     The *Note HTTPConnection: 22c. and *Note HTTPSConnection: 22d.
     classes now support a `source_address' parameter, a `(host, port)'
     2-tuple giving the source address that will be used for the
     connection.  (Contributed by Eldon Ziegler; issue 3972(39).)

   * The `ihooks' module now supports relative imports.  Note that
     `ihooks' is an older module for customizing imports, superseded by
     the *Note imputil: f8. module added in Python 2.0.  (Relative
     import support added by Neil Schemenauer.)

   * The *Note imaplib: f3. module now supports IPv6 addresses.
     (Contributed by Derek Morr; issue 1655(40).)

   * New function: the *Note inspect: f9. module’s *Note
     getcallargs(): 22e.  takes a callable and its positional and
     keyword arguments, and figures out which of the callable’s
     parameters will receive each argument, returning a dictionary
     mapping argument names to their values.  For example:

         >>> from inspect import getcallargs
         >>> def f(a, b=1, *pos, **named):
         ...     pass
         >>> getcallargs(f, 1, 2, 3)
         {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'pos': (3,), 'named': {}}
         >>> getcallargs(f, a=2, x=4)
         {'a': 2, 'b': 1, 'pos': (), 'named': {'x': 4}}
         >>> getcallargs(f)
         Traceback (most recent call last):
         ...
         TypeError: f() takes at least 1 argument (0 given)

     Contributed by George Sakkis; issue 3135(41).

   * Updated module: The *Note io: fa. library has been upgraded to the
     version shipped with Python 3.1.  For 3.1, the I/O library was
     entirely rewritten in C and is 2 to 20 times faster depending on
     the task being performed.  The original Python version was renamed
     to the `_pyio' module.

     One minor resulting change: the *Note io.TextIOBase: 22f. class now
     has an `errors' attribute giving the error setting used for
     encoding and decoding errors (one of `'strict'', `'replace'',
     `'ignore'').

     The *Note io.FileIO: 230. class now raises an *Note OSError: 231.
     when passed an invalid file descriptor.  (Implemented by Benjamin
     Peterson; issue 4991(42).)  The *Note truncate(): 232. method now
     preserves the file position; previously it would change the file
     position to the end of the new file.  (Fixed by Pascal Chambon;
     issue 6939(43).)

   * New function: `itertools.compress(data, selectors)' takes two
     iterators.  Elements of `data' are returned if the corresponding
     value in `selectors' is true:

         itertools.compress('ABCDEF', [1,0,1,0,1,1]) =>
           A, C, E, F

     New function: `itertools.combinations_with_replacement(iter, r)'
     returns all the possible `r'-length combinations of elements from
     the iterable `iter'.  Unlike *Note combinations(): 233, individual
     elements can be repeated in the generated combinations:

         itertools.combinations_with_replacement('abc', 2) =>
           ('a', 'a'), ('a', 'b'), ('a', 'c'),
           ('b', 'b'), ('b', 'c'), ('c', 'c')

     Note that elements are treated as unique depending on their
     position in the input, not their actual values.

     The *Note itertools.count(): 234. function now has a `step'
     argument that allows incrementing by values other than 1.  *Note
     count(): 234. also now allows keyword arguments, and using
     non-integer values such as floats or *Note Decimal: 1b5.
     instances.  (Implemented by Raymond Hettinger; issue 5032(44).)

     *Note itertools.combinations(): 233. and *Note
     itertools.product(): 235.  previously raised *Note ValueError:
     236. for values of `r' larger than the input iterable.  This was
     deemed a specification error, so they now return an empty
     iterator.  (Fixed by Raymond Hettinger; issue 4816(45).)

   * Updated module: The *Note json: fd. module was upgraded to version
     2.0.9 of the simplejson package, which includes a C extension that
     makes encoding and decoding faster.  (Contributed by Bob Ippolito;
     issue 4136(46).)

     To support the new *Note collections.OrderedDict: 1b6. type, *Note
     json.load(): 237.  now has an optional `object_pairs_hook'
     parameter that will be called with any object literal that decodes
     to a list of pairs.  (Contributed by Raymond Hettinger; issue
     5381(47).)

   * The *Note mailbox: 10a. module’s *Note Maildir: 238. class now
     records the timestamp on the directories it reads, and only
     re-reads them if the modification time has subsequently changed.
     This improves performance by avoiding unneeded directory scans.
     (Fixed by A.M. Kuchling and Antoine Pitrou; issue 1607951(48),
     issue 6896(49).)

   * New functions: the *Note math: 10d. module gained *Note erf():
     239. and *Note erfc(): 23a. for the error function and the
     complementary error function, *Note expm1(): 23b. which computes
     `e**x - 1' with more precision than using *Note exp(): 23c. and
     subtracting 1, *Note gamma(): 23d. for the Gamma function, and
     *Note lgamma(): 23e. for the natural log of the Gamma function.
     (Contributed by Mark Dickinson and nirinA raseliarison; issue
     3366(50).)

   * The *Note multiprocessing: 11a. module’s `Manager*' classes can
     now be passed a callable that will be called whenever a subprocess
     is started, along with a set of arguments that will be passed to
     the callable.  (Contributed by lekma; issue 5585(51).)

     The `Pool' class, which controls a pool of worker processes, now
     has an optional `maxtasksperchild' parameter.  Worker processes
     will perform the specified number of tasks and then exit, causing
     the `Pool' to start a new worker.  This is useful if tasks may leak
     memory or other resources, or if some tasks will cause the worker
     to become very large.  (Contributed by Charles Cazabon; issue
     6963(52).)

   * The *Note nntplib: 125. module now supports IPv6 addresses.
     (Contributed by Derek Morr; issue 1664(53).)

   * New functions: the *Note os: 129. module wraps the following POSIX
     system calls: *Note getresgid(): 23f. and *Note getresuid(): 240,
     which return the real, effective, and saved GIDs and UIDs; *Note
     setresgid(): 241. and *Note setresuid(): 242, which set real,
     effective, and saved GIDs and UIDs to new values; *Note
     initgroups(): 243, which initialize the group access list for the
     current process.  (GID/UID functions contributed by Travis H.;
     issue 6508(54).  Support for initgroups added by Jean-Paul
     Calderone; issue 7333(55).)

     The *Note os.fork(): 244. function now re-initializes the import
     lock in the child process; this fixes problems on Solaris when
     *Note fork(): 244.  is called from a thread.  (Fixed by Zsolt
     Cserna; issue 7242(56).)

   * In the *Note os.path: 12a. module, the *Note normpath(): 245. and
     *Note abspath(): 246. functions now preserve Unicode; if their
     input path is a Unicode string, the return value is also a Unicode
     string.  (*Note normpath(): 245. fixed by Matt Giuca in issue
     5827(57); *Note abspath(): 246. fixed by Ezio Melotti in issue
     3426(58).)

   * The *Note pydoc: 140. module now has help for the various symbols
     that Python uses.  You can now do `help('<<')' or `help('@')', for
     example.  (Contributed by David Laban; issue 4739(59).)

   * The *Note re: 144. module’s *Note split(): 247, *Note sub():
     248, and *Note subn(): 249.  now accept an optional `flags'
     argument, for consistency with the other functions in the module.
     (Added by Gregory P. Smith.)

   * New function: *Note run_path(): 24a. in the *Note runpy: 14b.
     module will execute the code at a provided `path' argument.
     `path' can be the path of a Python source file (`example.py'), a
     compiled bytecode file (`example.pyc'), a directory
     (`./package/'), or a zip archive (`example.zip').  If a directory
     or zip path is provided, it will be added to the front of
     `sys.path' and the module *Note __main__: 2. will be imported.
     It’s expected that the directory or zip contains a `__main__.py';
     if it doesn’t, some other `__main__.py' might be imported from a
     location later in `sys.path'.  This makes more of the machinery of
     *Note runpy: 14b. available to scripts that want to mimic the way
     Python’s command line processes an explicit path name.  (Added
     by Nick Coghlan; issue 6816(60).)

   * New function: in the *Note shutil: 154. module, *Note
     make_archive(): 24b.  takes a filename, archive type (zip or
     tar-format), and a directory path, and creates an archive
     containing the directory’s contents.  (Added by Tarek Ziadé.)

     *Note shutil: 154.’s *Note copyfile(): 24c. and *Note
     copytree(): 24d.  functions now raise a `SpecialFileError'
     exception when asked to copy a named pipe.  Previously the code
     would treat named pipes like a regular file by opening them for
     reading, and this would block indefinitely.  (Fixed by Antoine
     Pitrou; issue 3002(61).)

   * The *Note signal: 155. module no longer re-installs the signal
     handler unless this is truly necessary, which fixes a bug that
     could make it impossible to catch the EINTR signal robustly.
     (Fixed by Charles-Francois Natali; issue 8354(62).)

   * New functions: in the *Note site: 158. module, three new functions
     return various site- and user-specific paths.  *Note
     getsitepackages(): 24e. returns a list containing all global
     site-packages directories, *Note getusersitepackages(): 24f.
     returns the path of the user’s site-packages directory, and
     *Note getuserbase(): 250. returns the value of the `USER_BASE'
     environment variable, giving the path to a directory that can be
     used to store data.  (Contributed by Tarek Ziadé; issue 6693(63).)

     The *Note site: 158. module now reports exceptions occurring when
     the `sitecustomize' module is imported, and will no longer catch
     and swallow the *Note KeyboardInterrupt: 251. exception.  (Fixed by
     Victor Stinner; issue 3137(64).)

   * The *Note create_connection(): 252. function gained a
     `source_address' parameter, a `(host, port)' 2-tuple giving the
     source address that will be used for the connection.  (Contributed
     by Eldon Ziegler; issue 3972(65).)

     The *Note recv_into(): 253. and *Note recvfrom_into(): 254.
     methods will now write into objects that support the buffer API,
     most usefully the *Note bytearray: 1f7. and *Note memoryview: 1c4.
     objects.  (Implemented by Antoine Pitrou; issue 8104(66).)

   * The *Note SocketServer: 15d. module’s *Note TCPServer: 255.
     class now supports socket timeouts and disabling the Nagle
     algorithm.  The `disable_nagle_algorithm' class attribute defaults
     to `False'; if overridden to be true, new request connections will
     have the TCP_NODELAY option set to prevent buffering many small
     sends into a single TCP packet.  The *Note timeout: 256. class
     attribute can hold a timeout in seconds that will be applied to
     the request socket; if no request is received within that time,
     *Note handle_timeout(): 257.  will be called and *Note
     handle_request(): 258. will return.  (Contributed by Kristján
     Valur Jónsson; issue 6192(67) and issue 6267(68).)

   * Updated module: the *Note sqlite3: 15f. module has been updated to
     version 2.6.0 of the pysqlite package(69). Version 2.6.0 includes
     a number of bugfixes, and adds the ability to load SQLite
     extensions from shared libraries.  Call the
     `enable_load_extension(True)' method to enable extensions, and
     then call *Note load_extension(): 259. to load a particular shared
     library.  (Updated by Gerhard Häring.)

   * The *Note ssl: 160. module’s `SSLSocket' objects now support the
     buffer API, which fixed a test suite failure (fix by Antoine
     Pitrou; issue 7133(70)) and automatically set OpenSSL’s
     `SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY', which will prevent an error code being
     returned from `recv()' operations that trigger an SSL
     renegotiation (fix by Antoine Pitrou; issue 8222(71)).

     The *Note ssl.wrap_socket(): 25a. constructor function now takes a
     `ciphers' argument that’s a string listing the encryption
     algorithms to be allowed; the format of the string is described in
     the OpenSSL documentation(72).  (Added by Antoine Pitrou; issue
     8322(73).)

     Another change makes the extension load all of OpenSSL’s ciphers
     and digest algorithms so that they’re all available.  Some SSL
     certificates couldn’t be verified, reporting an “unknown
     algorithm” error.  (Reported by Beda Kosata, and fixed by
     Antoine Pitrou; issue 8484(74).)

     The version of OpenSSL being used is now available as the module
     attributes *Note ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION: 25b. (a string), *Note
     ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION_INFO: 25c. (a 5-tuple), and *Note
     ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER: 25d. (an integer).  (Added by Antoine
     Pitrou; issue 8321(75).)

   * The *Note struct: 166. module will no longer silently ignore
     overflow errors when a value is too large for a particular integer
     format code (one of `bBhHiIlLqQ'); it now always raises a *Note
     struct.error: 25e. exception.  (Changed by Mark Dickinson; issue
     1523(76).)  The *Note pack(): 25f. function will also attempt to
     use *Note __index__(): 260. to convert and pack non-integers
     before trying the *Note __int__(): 261. method or reporting an
     error.  (Changed by Mark Dickinson; issue 8300(77).)

   * New function: the *Note subprocess: 167. module’s *Note
     check_output(): 262. runs a command with a specified set of
     arguments and returns the command’s output as a string when the
     command runs without error, or raises a *Note CalledProcessError:
     263. exception otherwise.

         >>> subprocess.check_output(['df', '-h', '.'])
         'Filesystem     Size   Used  Avail Capacity  Mounted on\n
         /dev/disk0s2    52G    49G   3.0G    94%    /\n'

         >>> subprocess.check_output(['df', '-h', '/bogus'])
           ...
         subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '['df', '-h', '/bogus']' returned non-zero exit status 1

     (Contributed by Gregory P. Smith.)

     The *Note subprocess: 167. module will now retry its internal
     system calls on receiving an `EINTR' signal.  (Reported by several
     people; final patch by Gregory P. Smith in issue 1068268(78).)

   * New function: *Note is_declared_global(): 264. in the *Note
     symtable: 16c. module returns true for variables that are
     explicitly declared to be global, false for ones that are
     implicitly global.  (Contributed by Jeremy Hylton.)

   * The *Note syslog: 16f. module will now use the value of
     `sys.argv[0]' as the identifier instead of the previous default
     value of `'python''.  (Changed by Sean Reifschneider; issue
     8451(79).)

   * The `sys.version_info' value is now a named tuple, with attributes
     named `major', `minor', `micro', `releaselevel', and `serial'.
     (Contributed by Ross Light; issue 4285(80).)

     *Note sys.getwindowsversion(): 265. also returns a named tuple,
     with attributes named `major', `minor', `build', *Note platform:
     133, `service_pack', `service_pack_major', `service_pack_minor',
     `suite_mask', and `product_type'.  (Contributed by Brian Curtin;
     issue 7766(81).)

   * The *Note tarfile: 171. module’s default error handling has
     changed, to no longer suppress fatal errors.  The default error
     level was previously 0, which meant that errors would only result
     in a message being written to the debug log, but because the debug
     log is not activated by default, these errors go unnoticed.  The
     default error level is now 1, which raises an exception if
     there’s an error.  (Changed by Lars Gustäbel; issue 7357(82).)

     *Note tarfile: 171. now supports filtering the *Note TarInfo: 266.
     objects being added to a tar file.  When you call *Note add(): 267,
     you may supply an optional `filter' argument that’s a callable.
     The `filter' callable will be passed the *Note TarInfo: 266. for
     every file being added, and can modify and return it.  If the
     callable returns `None', the file will be excluded from the
     resulting archive.  This is more powerful than the existing
     `exclude' argument, which has therefore been deprecated.  (Added
     by Lars Gustäbel; issue 6856(83).)  The *Note TarFile: 268. class
     also now supports the context management protocol.  (Added by Lars
     Gustäbel; issue 7232(84).)

   * The *Note wait(): 269. method of the *Note threading.Event: 26a.
     class now returns the internal flag on exit.  This means the
     method will usually return true because *Note wait(): 269. is
     supposed to block until the internal flag becomes true.  The
     return value will only be false if a timeout was provided and the
     operation timed out.  (Contributed by Tim Lesher; issue
     1674032(85).)

   * The Unicode database provided by the *Note unicodedata: 186.
     module is now used internally to determine which characters are
     numeric, whitespace, or represent line breaks.  The database also
     includes information from the `Unihan.txt' data file (patch by
     Anders Chrigström and Amaury Forgeot d’Arc; issue 1571184(86))
     and has been updated to version 5.2.0 (updated by Florent Xicluna;
     issue 8024(87)).

   * The *Note urlparse: 18a. module’s *Note urlsplit(): 26b. now
     handles unknown URL schemes in a fashion compliant with RFC
     3986(88): if the URL is of the form `"<something>://..."', the
     text before the `://' is treated as the scheme, even if it’s a
     made-up scheme that the module doesn’t know about.  This change
     may break code that worked around the old behaviour.  For example,
     Python 2.6.4 or 2.5 will return the following:

         >>> import urlparse
         >>> urlparse.urlsplit('invented://host/filename?query')
         ('invented', '', '//host/filename?query', '', '')

     Python 2.7 (and Python 2.6.5) will return:

         >>> import urlparse
         >>> urlparse.urlsplit('invented://host/filename?query')
         ('invented', 'host', '/filename?query', '', '')

     (Python 2.7 actually produces slightly different output, since it
     returns a named tuple instead of a standard tuple.)

     The *Note urlparse: 18a. module also supports IPv6 literal
     addresses as defined by RFC 2732(89) (contributed by Senthil
     Kumaran; issue 2987(90)).

         >>> urlparse.urlparse('http://[1080::8:800:200C:417A]/foo')
         ParseResult(scheme='http', netloc='[1080::8:800:200C:417A]',
                     path='/foo', params='', query='', fragment='')

   * New class: the *Note WeakSet: 26c. class in the *Note weakref: 195.
     module is a set that only holds weak references to its elements;
     elements will be removed once there are no references pointing to
     them.  (Originally implemented in Python 3.x by Raymond Hettinger,
     and backported to 2.7 by Michael Foord.)

   * The ElementTree library, `xml.etree', no longer escapes ampersands
     and angle brackets when outputting an XML processing instruction
     (which looks like `<?xml-stylesheet href="#style1"?>') or comment
     (which looks like `<!-- comment -->').  (Patch by Neil Muller;
     issue 2746(91).)

   * The XML-RPC client and server, provided by the *Note xmlrpclib:
     1aa. and *Note SimpleXMLRPCServer: 157. modules, have improved
     performance by supporting HTTP/1.1 keep-alive and by optionally
     using gzip encoding to compress the XML being exchanged.  The gzip
     compression is controlled by the `encode_threshold' attribute of
     `SimpleXMLRPCRequestHandler', which contains a size in bytes;
     responses larger than this will be compressed.  (Contributed by
     Kristján Valur Jónsson; issue 6267(92).)

   * The *Note zipfile: 1ab. module’s *Note ZipFile: 26d. now
     supports the context management protocol, so you can write `with
     zipfile.ZipFile(...) as f:'.  (Contributed by Brian Curtin; issue
     5511(93).)

     *Note zipfile: 1ab. now also supports archiving empty directories
     and extracts them correctly.  (Fixed by Kuba Wieczorek; issue
     4710(94).)  Reading files out of an archive is faster, and
     interleaving *Note read(): 26e. and `readline()' now works
     correctly.  (Contributed by Nir Aides; issue 7610(95).)

     The *Note is_zipfile(): 26f. function now accepts a file object,
     in addition to the path names accepted in earlier versions.
     (Contributed by Gabriel Genellina; issue 4756(96).)

     The *Note writestr(): 270. method now has an optional
     `compress_type' parameter that lets you override the default
     compression method specified in the *Note ZipFile: 26d.
     constructor.  (Contributed by Ronald Oussoren; issue 6003(97).)

File: python.info,  Node: New module importlib,  Next: New module sysconfig,  Up: New and Improved Modules

1.1.11.1 New module: importlib
..............................

Python 3.1 includes the *Note importlib: f7. package, a
re-implementation of the logic underlying Python’s *Note import: 1f4.
statement.  *Note importlib: f7. is useful for implementors of Python
interpreters and to users who wish to write new importers that can
participate in the import process.  Python 2.7 doesn’t contain the
complete *Note importlib: f7. package, but instead has a tiny subset
that contains a single function, *Note import_module(): 272.

`import_module(name, package=None)' imports a module.  `name' is a
string containing the module or package’s name.  It’s possible to do
relative imports by providing a string that begins with a `.'
character, such as `..utils.errors'.  For relative imports, the
`package' argument must be provided and is the name of the package that
will be used as the anchor for the relative import.  *Note
import_module(): 272. both inserts the imported module into
`sys.modules' and returns the module object.

Here are some examples:

    >>> from importlib import import_module
    >>> anydbm = import_module('anydbm')  # Standard absolute import
    >>> anydbm
    <module 'anydbm' from '/p/python/Lib/anydbm.py'>
    >>> # Relative import
    >>> file_util = import_module('..file_util', 'distutils.command')
    >>> file_util
    <module 'distutils.file_util' from '/python/Lib/distutils/file_util.pyc'>

*Note importlib: f7. was implemented by Brett Cannon and introduced in
Python 3.1.


File: python.info,  Node: New module sysconfig,  Next: ttk Themed Widgets for Tk,  Prev: New module importlib,  Up: New and Improved Modules

1.1.11.2 New module: sysconfig
..............................

The *Note sysconfig: 16e. module has been pulled out of the Distutils
package, becoming a new top-level module in its own right.  *Note
sysconfig: 16e. provides functions for getting information about
Python’s build process: compiler switches, installation paths, the
platform name, and whether Python is running from its source directory.

Some of the functions in the module are:

   * *Note get_config_var(): 274. returns variables from Python’s
     Makefile and the `pyconfig.h' file.

   * *Note get_config_vars(): 275. returns a dictionary containing all
     of the configuration variables.

   * *Note get_path(): 276. returns the configured path for a
     particular type of module: the standard library, site-specific
     modules, platform-specific modules, etc.

   * *Note is_python_build(): 277. returns true if you’re running a
     binary from a Python source tree, and false otherwise.

Consult the *Note sysconfig: 16e. documentation for more details and for
a complete list of functions.

The Distutils package and *Note sysconfig: 16e. are now maintained by
Tarek Ziadé, who has also started a Distutils2 package (source
repository at <https://hg.python.org/distutils2/>) for developing a
next-generation version of Distutils.

1.1.11.3 ttk: Themed Widgets for Tk
...................................

Tcl/Tk 8.5 includes a set of themed widgets that re-implement basic Tk
widgets but have a more customizable appearance and can therefore more
closely resemble the native platform’s widgets.  This widget set was
originally called Tile, but was renamed to Ttk (for “themed Tk”) on
being added to Tcl/Tck release 8.5.

To learn more, read the *Note ttk: 182. module documentation.  You may
also wish to read the Tcl/Tk manual page describing the Ttk theme
engine, available at
<https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TkCmd/ttk_intro.htm>. Some screenshots
of the Python/Ttk code in use are at
<http://code.google.com/p/python-ttk/wiki/Screenshots>.

The *Note ttk: 182. module was written by Guilherme Polo and added in
issue 2983(1).  An alternate version called `Tile.py', written by
Martin Franklin and maintained by Kevin Walzer, was proposed for
inclusion in issue 2618(2), but the authors argued that Guilherme
Polo’s work was more comprehensive.

1.1.11.4 Updated module: unittest
.................................

The *Note unittest: 187. module was greatly enhanced; many new features
were added.  Most of these features were implemented by Michael Foord,
unless otherwise noted.  The enhanced version of the module is
downloadable separately for use with Python versions 2.4 to 2.6,
packaged as the `unittest2' package, from
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unittest2>.

When used from the command line, the module can automatically discover
tests.  It’s not as fancy as py.test(1) or nose(2), but provides a
simple way to run tests kept within a set of package directories.  For
example, the following command will search the `test/' subdirectory for
any importable test files named `test*.py':

    python -m unittest discover -s test

Consult the *Note unittest: 187. module documentation for more details.
(Developed in issue 6001(3).)

The *Note main(): 27b. function supports some other new options:

   * *Note -b: 27c. or `--buffer' will buffer the standard output and
     standard error streams during each test.  If the test passes, any
     resulting output will be discarded; on failure, the buffered
     output will be displayed.

   * *Note -c: 27d. or `--catch' will cause the control-C interrupt to
     be handled more gracefully.  Instead of interrupting the test
     process immediately, the currently running test will be completed
     and then the partial results up to the interruption will be
     reported.  If you’re impatient, a second press of control-C will
     cause an immediate interruption.

     This control-C handler tries to avoid causing problems when the
     code being tested or the tests being run have defined a signal
     handler of their own, by noticing that a signal handler was
     already set and calling it.  If this doesn’t work for you,
     there’s a *Note removeHandler(): 27e. decorator that can be used
     to mark tests that should have the control-C handling disabled.

   * *Note -f: 27f. or `--failfast' makes test execution stop
     immediately when a test fails instead of continuing to execute
     further tests.  (Suggested by Cliff Dyer and implemented by
     Michael Foord; issue 8074(4).)

The progress messages now show ‘x’ for expected failures and
‘u’ for unexpected successes when run in verbose mode.
(Contributed by Benjamin Peterson.)

Test cases can raise the *Note SkipTest: 280. exception to skip a test
(issue 1034053(5)).

The error messages for *Note assertEqual(): 281, *Note assertTrue():
282, and *Note assertFalse(): 283.  failures now provide more
information.  If you set the *Note longMessage: 284. attribute of your
*Note TestCase: 285. classes to true, both the standard error message
and any additional message you provide will be printed for failures.
(Added by Michael Foord; issue 5663(6).)

The *Note assertRaises(): 286. method now returns a context handler
when called without providing a callable object to run.  For example,
you can write this:

    with self.assertRaises(KeyError):
        {}['foo']

(Implemented by Antoine Pitrou; issue 4444(7).)

Module- and class-level setup and teardown fixtures are now supported.
Modules can contain `setUpModule()' and `tearDownModule()' functions.
Classes can have *Note setUpClass(): 287. and *Note tearDownClass():
288. methods that must be defined as class methods (using
`@classmethod' or equivalent).  These functions and methods are invoked
when the test runner switches to a test case in a different module or
class.

The methods *Note addCleanup(): 289. and *Note doCleanups(): 28a. were
added.  *Note addCleanup(): 289. lets you add cleanup functions that
will be called unconditionally (after *Note setUp(): 28b. if *Note
setUp(): 28b. fails, otherwise after *Note tearDown(): 28c.). This
allows for much simpler resource allocation and deallocation during
tests (issue 5679(8)).

A number of new methods were added that provide more specialized tests.
Many of these methods were written by Google engineers for use in
their test suites; Gregory P. Smith, Michael Foord, and GvR worked on
merging them into Python’s version of *Note unittest: 187.

   * *Note assertIsNone(): 28d. and *Note assertIsNotNone(): 28e. take
     one expression and verify that the result is or is not `None'.

   * *Note assertIs(): 28f. and *Note assertIsNot(): 290.  take two
     values and check whether the two values evaluate to the same
     object or not.  (Added by Michael Foord; issue 2578(9).)

   * *Note assertIsInstance(): 291. and *Note assertNotIsInstance():
     292. check whether the resulting object is an instance of a
     particular class, or of one of a tuple of classes.  (Added by
     Georg Brandl; issue 7031(10).)

   * *Note assertGreater(): 293, *Note assertGreaterEqual(): 294, *Note
     assertLess(): 295, and *Note assertLessEqual(): 296. compare two
     quantities.

   * *Note assertMultiLineEqual(): 297. compares two strings, and if
     they’re not equal, displays a helpful comparison that highlights
     the differences in the two strings.  This comparison is now used by
     default when Unicode strings are compared with *Note
     assertEqual(): 281.

   * *Note assertRegexpMatches(): 298. and *Note
     assertNotRegexpMatches(): 299. checks whether the first argument
     is a string matching or not matching the regular expression
     provided as the second argument (issue 8038(11)).

   * *Note assertRaisesRegexp(): 29a. checks whether a particular
     exception is raised, and then also checks that the string
     representation of the exception matches the provided regular
     expression.

   * *Note assertIn(): 29b. and *Note assertNotIn(): 29c.  tests
     whether `first' is or is not in  `second'.

   * *Note assertItemsEqual(): 29d. tests whether two provided sequences
     contain the same elements.

   * *Note assertSetEqual(): 29e. compares whether two sets are equal,
     and only reports the differences between the sets in case of error.

   * Similarly, *Note assertListEqual(): 29f. and *Note
     assertTupleEqual(): 2a0.  compare the specified types and explain
     any differences without necessarily printing their full values;
     these methods are now used by default when comparing lists and
     tuples using *Note assertEqual(): 281.  More generally, *Note
     assertSequenceEqual(): 2a1. compares two sequences and can
     optionally check whether both sequences are of a particular type.

   * *Note assertDictEqual(): 2a2. compares two dictionaries and
     reports the differences; it’s now used by default when you
     compare two dictionaries using *Note assertEqual(): 281.  *Note
     assertDictContainsSubset(): 2a3. checks whether all of the
     key/value pairs in `first' are found in `second'.

   * *Note assertAlmostEqual(): 2a4. and *Note assertNotAlmostEqual():
     2a5. test whether `first' and `second' are approximately equal.
     This method can either round their difference to an
     optionally-specified number of `places' (the default is 7) and
     compare it to zero, or require the difference to be smaller than a
     supplied `delta' value.

   * *Note loadTestsFromName(): 2a6. properly honors the *Note
     suiteClass: 2a7. attribute of the *Note TestLoader: 2a8. (Fixed by
     Mark Roddy; issue 6866(12).)

   * A new hook lets you extend the *Note assertEqual(): 281. method to
     handle new data types.  The *Note addTypeEqualityFunc(): 2a9.
     method takes a type object and a function. The function will be
     used when both of the objects being compared are of the specified
     type.  This function should compare the two objects and raise an
     exception if they don’t match; it’s a good idea for the
     function to provide additional information about why the two
     objects aren’t matching, much as the new sequence comparison
     methods do.

*Note unittest.main(): 27b. now takes an optional `exit' argument.  If
false, *Note main(): 27b. doesn’t call *Note sys.exit(): 2aa, allowing
*Note main(): 27b. to be used from the interactive interpreter.
(Contributed by J. Pablo Fernández; issue 3379(13).)

*Note TestResult: 2ab. has new *Note startTestRun(): 2ac. and *Note
stopTestRun(): 2ad. methods that are called immediately before and
after a test run.  (Contributed by Robert Collins; issue 5728(14).)

With all these changes, the `unittest.py' was becoming awkwardly large,
so the module was turned into a package and the code split into several
files (by Benjamin Peterson).  This doesn’t affect how the module is
imported or used.

File: python.info,  Node: Updated module ElementTree 1 3,  Prev: Updated module unittest,  Up: New and Improved Modules

1.1.11.5 Updated module: ElementTree 1.3
........................................

The version of the ElementTree library included with Python was updated
to version 1.3.  Some of the new features are:

   * The various parsing functions now take a `parser' keyword argument
     giving an *Note XMLParser: 2b0. instance that will be used.  This
     makes it possible to override the file’s internal encoding:

         p = ET.XMLParser(encoding='utf-8')
         t = ET.XML("""<root/>""", parser=p)

     Errors in parsing XML now raise a `ParseError' exception, whose
     instances have a `position' attribute containing a (`line',
     `column') tuple giving the location of the problem.

   * ElementTree’s code for converting trees to a string has been
     significantly reworked, making it roughly twice as fast in many
     cases.  The *Note ElementTree.write(): 2b1.  and `Element.write()'
     methods now have a `method' parameter that can be “xml” (the
     default), “html”, or “text”.  HTML mode will output empty
     elements as `<empty></empty>' instead of `<empty/>', and text mode
     will skip over elements and only output the text chunks.  If you
     set the `tag' attribute of an element to `None' but leave its
     children in place, the element will be omitted when the tree is
     written out, so you don’t need to do more extensive rearrangement
     to remove a single element.

     Namespace handling has also been improved.  All `xmlns:<whatever>'
     declarations are now output on the root element, not scattered
     throughout the resulting XML.  You can set the default namespace
     for a tree by setting the `default_namespace' attribute and can
     register new prefixes with *Note register_namespace(): 2b2.  In
     XML mode, you can use the true/false `xml_declaration' parameter
     to suppress the XML declaration.

   * New *Note Element: 2b3. method: *Note extend(): 2b4. appends the
     items from a sequence to the element’s children.  Elements
     themselves behave like sequences, so it’s easy to move children
     from one element to another:

         from xml.etree import ElementTree as ET

         t = ET.XML("""<list>
           <item>1</item> <item>2</item>  <item>3</item>
         </list>""")
         new = ET.XML('<root/>')
         new.extend(t)

         # Outputs <root><item>1</item>...</root>
         print ET.tostring(new)

   * New `Element' method: *Note iter(): 2b5. yields the children of the
     element as a generator.  It’s also possible to write `for child
     in elem:' to loop over an element’s children.  The existing
     method `getiterator()' is now deprecated, as is `getchildren()'
     which constructs and returns a list of children.

   * New `Element' method: *Note itertext(): 2b6. yields all chunks of
     text that are descendants of the element.  For example:

         t = ET.XML("""<list>
           <item>1</item> <item>2</item>  <item>3</item>
         </list>""")

         # Outputs ['\n  ', '1', ' ', '2', '  ', '3', '\n']
         print list(t.itertext())

   * Deprecated: using an element as a Boolean (i.e., `if elem:') would
     return true if the element had any children, or false if there were
     no children.  This behaviour is confusing – `None' is false, but
     so is a childless element? – so it will now trigger a *Note
     FutureWarning: 2b7.  In your code, you should be explicit: write
     `len(elem) != 0' if you’re interested in the number of children,
     or `elem is not None'.

Fredrik Lundh develops ElementTree and produced the 1.3 version; you
can read his article describing 1.3 at
<http://effbot.org/zone/elementtree-13-intro.htm>.  Florent Xicluna
updated the version included with Python, after discussions on
python-dev and in issue 6472(1).)

File: python.info,  Node: Build and C API Changes,  Next: Other Changes and Fixes,  Prev: New and Improved Modules,  Up: What’s New in Python 2 7

1.1.12 Build and C API Changes
------------------------------

Changes to Python’s build process and to the C API include:

   * The latest release of the GNU Debugger, GDB 7, can be scripted
     using Python(1).  When you begin debugging an executable program
     P, GDB will look for a file named `P-gdb.py' and automatically
     read it.  Dave Malcolm contributed a `python-gdb.py' that adds a
     number of commands useful when debugging Python itself.  For
     example, `py-up' and `py-down' go up or down one Python stack
     frame, which usually corresponds to several C stack frames.
     `py-print' prints the value of a Python variable, and `py-bt'
     prints the Python stack trace.  (Added as a result of issue
     8032(2).)

   * If you use the `.gdbinit' file provided with Python, the “pyo”
     macro in the 2.7 version now works correctly when the thread being
     debugged doesn’t hold the GIL; the macro now acquires it before
     printing.  (Contributed by Victor Stinner; issue 3632(3).)

   * *Note Py_AddPendingCall(): 2b9. is now thread-safe, letting any
     worker thread submit notifications to the main Python thread.  This
     is particularly useful for asynchronous IO operations.
     (Contributed by Kristján Valur Jónsson; issue 4293(4).)

   * New function: *Note PyCode_NewEmpty(): 2ba. creates an empty code
     object; only the filename, function name, and first line number
     are required.  This is useful for extension modules that are
     attempting to construct a more useful traceback stack.  Previously
     such extensions needed to call *Note PyCode_New(): 2bb, which had
     many more arguments.  (Added by Jeffrey Yasskin.)

   * New function: *Note PyErr_NewExceptionWithDoc(): 2bc. creates a new
     exception class, just as the existing *Note PyErr_NewException():
     2bd. does, but takes an extra `char *' argument containing the
     docstring for the new exception class.  (Added by ‘lekma’ on
     the Python bug tracker; issue 7033(5).)

   * New function: *Note PyFrame_GetLineNumber(): 2be. takes a frame
     object and returns the line number that the frame is currently
     executing.  Previously code would need to get the index of the
     bytecode instruction currently executing, and then look up the
     line number corresponding to that address.  (Added by Jeffrey
     Yasskin.)

   * New functions: *Note PyLong_AsLongAndOverflow(): 1c9. and *Note
     PyLong_AsLongLongAndOverflow(): 2bf.  approximates a Python long
     integer as a C `long' or `long long'.  If the number is too large
     to fit into the output type, an `overflow' flag is set and
     returned to the caller.  (Contributed by Case Van Horsen; issue
     7528(6) and issue 7767(7).)

   * New function: stemming from the rewrite of string-to-float
     conversion, a new *Note PyOS_string_to_double(): 2c0. function was
     added.  The old *Note PyOS_ascii_strtod(): 2c1. and *Note
     PyOS_ascii_atof(): 2c2. functions are now deprecated.

   * New function: *Note PySys_SetArgvEx(): 2c3. sets the value of
     `sys.argv' and can optionally update `sys.path' to include the
     directory containing the script named by `sys.argv[0]' depending
     on the value of an `updatepath' parameter.

     This function was added to close a security hole for applications
     that embed Python.  The old function, *Note PySys_SetArgv(): 2c4,
     would always update `sys.path', and sometimes it would add the
     current directory.  This meant that, if you ran an application
     embedding Python in a directory controlled by someone else,
     attackers could put a Trojan-horse module in the directory (say, a
     file named `os.py') that your application would then import and
     run.

     If you maintain a C/C++ application that embeds Python, check
     whether you’re calling *Note PySys_SetArgv(): 2c4. and carefully
     consider whether the application should be using *Note
     PySys_SetArgvEx(): 2c3.  with `updatepath' set to false.

     Security issue reported as CVE-2008-5983(8); discussed in issue
     5753(9), and fixed by Antoine Pitrou.

   * New macros: the Python header files now define the following
     macros: `Py_ISALNUM', `Py_ISALPHA', `Py_ISDIGIT', `Py_ISLOWER',
     `Py_ISSPACE', `Py_ISUPPER', `Py_ISXDIGIT', `Py_TOLOWER', and
     `Py_TOUPPER'.  All of these functions are analogous to the C
     standard macros for classifying characters, but ignore the current
     locale setting, because in several places Python needs to analyze
     characters in a locale-independent way.  (Added by Eric Smith;
     issue 5793(10).)

   * Removed function: `PyEval_CallObject' is now only available as a
     macro.  A function version was being kept around to preserve ABI
     linking compatibility, but that was in 1997; it can certainly be
     deleted by now.  (Removed by Antoine Pitrou; issue 8276(11).)

   * New format codes: the `PyFormat_FromString()',
     `PyFormat_FromStringV()', and *Note PyErr_Format(): 2c5. functions
     now accept `%lld' and `%llu' format codes for displaying C’s
     `long long' types.  (Contributed by Mark Dickinson; issue
     7228(12).)

   * The complicated interaction between threads and process forking has
     been changed.  Previously, the child process created by *Note
     os.fork(): 244. might fail because the child is created with only a
     single thread running, the thread performing the *Note os.fork():
     244.  If other threads were holding a lock, such as Python’s
     import lock, when the fork was performed, the lock would still be
     marked as “held” in the new process.  But in the child process
     nothing would ever release the lock, since the other threads
     weren’t replicated, and the child process would no longer be
     able to perform imports.

     Python 2.7 acquires the import lock before performing an *Note
     os.fork(): 244, and will also clean up any locks created using the
     *Note threading: 179. module.  C extension modules that have
     internal locks, or that call `fork()' themselves, will not benefit
     from this clean-up.

     (Fixed by Thomas Wouters; issue 1590864(13).)

   * The *Note Py_Finalize(): 2c6. function now calls the internal
     `threading._shutdown()' function; this prevents some exceptions
     from being raised when an interpreter shuts down.  (Patch by Adam
     Olsen; issue 1722344(14).)

   * When using the *Note PyMemberDef: 2c7. structure to define
     attributes of a type, Python will no longer let you try to delete
     or set a `T_STRING_INPLACE' attribute.

   * Global symbols defined by the *Note ctypes: 78. module are now
     prefixed with `Py', or with `_ctypes'.  (Implemented by Thomas
     Heller; issue 3102(15).)

   * New configure option: the `--with-system-expat' switch allows
     building the `pyexpat' module to use the system Expat library.
     (Contributed by Arfrever Frehtes Taifersar Arahesis; issue
     7609(16).)

   * New configure option: the `--with-valgrind' option will now
     disable the pymalloc allocator, which is difficult for the
     Valgrind memory-error detector to analyze correctly.  Valgrind
     will therefore be better at detecting memory leaks and overruns.
     (Contributed by James Henstridge; issue 2422(17).)

   * New configure option: you can now supply an empty string to
     `--with-dbmliborder=' in order to disable all of the various DBM
     modules.  (Added by Arfrever Frehtes Taifersar Arahesis; issue
     6491(18).)

   * The `configure' script now checks for floating-point rounding bugs
     on certain 32-bit Intel chips and defines a `X87_DOUBLE_ROUNDING'
     preprocessor definition.  No code currently uses this definition,
     but it’s available if anyone wishes to use it.  (Added by Mark
     Dickinson; issue 2937(19).)

     `configure' also now sets a `LDCXXSHARED' Makefile variable for
     supporting C++ linking.  (Contributed by Arfrever Frehtes
     Taifersar Arahesis; issue 1222585(20).)

   * The build process now creates the necessary files for pkg-config
     support.  (Contributed by Clinton Roy; issue 3585(21).)

   * The build process now supports Subversion 1.7.  (Contributed by
     Arfrever Frehtes Taifersar Arahesis; issue 6094(22).)

1.1.12.1 Capsules
.................

Python 3.1 adds a new C datatype, *Note PyCapsule: 1c8, for providing a
C API to an extension module.  A capsule is essentially the holder of a
C `void *' pointer, and is made available as a module attribute; for
example, the *Note socket: 15c. module’s API is exposed as
`socket.CAPI', and *Note unicodedata: 186. exposes `ucnhash_CAPI'.
Other extensions can import the module, access its dictionary to get
the capsule object, and then get the `void *' pointer, which will
usually point to an array of pointers to the module’s various API
functions.

There is an existing data type already used for this, *Note PyCObject:
2ca, but it doesn’t provide type safety.  Evil code written in pure
Python could cause a segmentation fault by taking a *Note PyCObject:
2ca. from module A and somehow substituting it for the *Note PyCObject:
2ca. in module B.   Capsules know their own name, and getting the
pointer requires providing the name:

    void *vtable;

    if (!PyCapsule_IsValid(capsule, "mymodule.CAPI") {
            PyErr_SetString(PyExc_ValueError, "argument type invalid");
            return NULL;
    }

    vtable = PyCapsule_GetPointer(capsule, "mymodule.CAPI");

You are assured that `vtable' points to whatever you’re expecting.
If a different capsule was passed in, *Note PyCapsule_IsValid(): 2cb.
would detect the mismatched name and return false.  Refer to *Note
Providing a C API for an Extension Module: 2cc. for more information on
using these objects.

Python 2.7 now uses capsules internally to provide various
extension-module APIs, but the *Note PyCObject_AsVoidPtr(): 2cd. was
modified to handle capsules, preserving compile-time compatibility with
the `CObject' interface.  Use of *Note PyCObject_AsVoidPtr(): 2cd. will
signal a *Note PendingDeprecationWarning: 1f0, which is silent by
default.

Implemented in Python 3.1 and backported to 2.7 by Larry Hastings;
discussed in issue 5630(1).

1.1.12.2 Port-Specific Changes: Windows
.......................................

   * The *Note msvcrt: 118. module now contains some constants from the
     `crtassem.h' header file: `CRT_ASSEMBLY_VERSION',
     `VC_ASSEMBLY_PUBLICKEYTOKEN', and `LIBRARIES_ASSEMBLY_NAME_PREFIX'.
     (Contributed by David Cournapeau; issue 4365(1).)

   * The *Note _winreg: 3. module for accessing the registry now
     implements the *Note CreateKeyEx(): 2cf. and *Note DeleteKeyEx():
     2d0.  functions, extended versions of previously-supported
     functions that take several extra arguments.  The *Note
     DisableReflectionKey(): 2d1, *Note EnableReflectionKey(): 2d2, and
     *Note QueryReflectionKey(): 2d3.  were also tested and documented.
     (Implemented by Brian Curtin: issue 7347(2).)

   * The new `_beginthreadex()' API is used to start threads, and the
     native thread-local storage functions are now used.  (Contributed
     by Kristján Valur Jónsson; issue 3582(3).)

   * The *Note os.kill(): 2d4. function now works on Windows.  The
     signal value can be the constants `CTRL_C_EVENT',
     `CTRL_BREAK_EVENT', or any integer.  The first two constants will
     send `Control-C' and `Control-Break' keystroke events to
     subprocesses; any other value will use the `TerminateProcess()'
     API.  (Contributed by Miki Tebeka; issue 1220212(4).)

   * The *Note os.listdir(): 2d5. function now correctly fails for an
     empty path.  (Fixed by Hirokazu Yamamoto; issue 5913(5).)

   * The `mimelib' module will now read the MIME database from the
     Windows registry when initializing.  (Patch by Gabriel Genellina;
     issue 4969(6).)

........................................

   * The path `/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages' is now appended to
     `sys.path', in order to share added packages between the system
     installation and a user-installed copy of the same version.
     (Changed by Ronald Oussoren; issue 4865(1).)

          Changed in version 2.7.13: As of 2.7.13, this change was
          removed.  `/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages', the
          site-packages directory used by the Apple-supplied system
          Python 2.7 is no longer appended to `sys.path' for
          user-installed Pythons such as from the python.org
          installers.  As of macOS 10.12, Apple changed how the system
          site-packages directory is configured, which could cause
          installation of pip components, like setuptools, to fail.
          Packages installed for the system Python will no longer be
          shared with user-installed Pythons. (issue 28440(2))

1.1.13 Other Changes and Fixes
------------------------------

   * Two benchmark scripts, `iobench' and `ccbench', were added to the
     `Tools' directory.  `iobench' measures the speed of the built-in
     file I/O objects returned by *Note open(): 2d9.  while performing
     various operations, and `ccbench' is a concurrency benchmark that
     tries to measure computing throughput, thread switching latency,
     and IO processing bandwidth when performing several tasks using a
     varying number of threads.

   * The `Tools/i18n/msgfmt.py' script now understands plural forms in
     `.po' files.  (Fixed by Martin von Löwis; issue 5464(1).)

   * When importing a module from a `.pyc' or `.pyo' file with an
     existing `.py' counterpart, the `co_filename' attributes of the
     resulting code objects are overwritten when the original filename
     is obsolete.  This can happen if the file has been renamed, moved,
     or is accessed through different paths.  (Patch by Ziga Seilnacht
     and Jean-Paul Calderone; issue 1180193(2).)

   * The `regrtest.py' script now takes a `--randseed=' switch that
     takes an integer that will be used as the random seed for the `-r'
     option that executes tests in random order.  The `-r' option also
     reports the seed that was used (Added by Collin Winter.)

   * Another `regrtest.py' switch is `-j', which takes an integer
     specifying how many tests run in parallel. This allows reducing
     the total runtime on multi-core machines.  This option is
     compatible with several other options, including the `-R' switch
     which is known to produce long runtimes.  (Added by Antoine
     Pitrou, issue 6152(3).)  This can also be used with a new `-F'
     switch that runs selected tests in a loop until they fail.  (Added
     by Antoine Pitrou; issue 7312(4).)

   * When executed as a script, the `py_compile.py' module now accepts
     `'-'' as an argument, which will read standard input for the list
     of filenames to be compiled.  (Contributed by Piotr Ożarowski;
     issue 8233(5).)

1.1.14 Porting to Python 2.7
----------------------------

This section lists previously described changes and other bugfixes that
may require changes to your code:

   * The *Note range(): 2db. function processes its arguments more
     consistently; it will now call *Note __int__(): 261. on non-float,
     non-integer arguments that are supplied to it.  (Fixed by Alexander
     Belopolsky; issue 1533(1).)

   * The string *Note format(): 1ef. method changed the default
     precision used for floating-point and complex numbers from 6
     decimal places to 12, which matches the precision used by *Note
     str(): 1ea.  (Changed by Eric Smith; issue 5920(2).)

   * Because of an optimization for the *Note with: 1c1. statement, the
     special methods *Note __enter__(): 1ff. and *Note __exit__(): 200.
     must belong to the object’s type, and cannot be directly
     attached to the object’s instance.  This affects new-style
     classes (derived from *Note object: 1f1.) and C extension types.
     (issue 6101(3).)

   * Due to a bug in Python 2.6, the `exc_value' parameter to *Note
     __exit__(): 200. methods was often the string representation of the
     exception, not an instance.  This was fixed in 2.7, so `exc_value'
     will be an instance as expected.  (Fixed by Florent Xicluna; issue
     7853(4).)

   * When a restricted set of attributes were set using `__slots__',
     deleting an unset attribute would not raise *Note AttributeError:
     1f8.  as you would expect.  Fixed by Benjamin Peterson; issue
     7604(5).)

In the standard library:

   * Operations with *Note datetime: 2dc. instances that resulted in a
     year falling outside the supported range didn’t always raise
     *Note OverflowError: 2dd.  Such errors are now checked more
     carefully and will now raise the exception. (Reported by Mark
     Leander, patch by Anand B. Pillai and Alexander Belopolsky; issue
     7150(6).)

   * When using *Note Decimal: 1b5. instances with a string’s *Note
     format(): 1ef. method, the default alignment was previously
     left-alignment.  This has been changed to right-alignment, which
     might change the output of your programs.  (Changed by Mark
     Dickinson; issue 6857(7).)

     Comparisons involving a signaling NaN value (or `sNAN') now signal
     *Note InvalidOperation: 2de. instead of silently returning a true
     or false value depending on the comparison operator.  Quiet NaN
     values (or `NaN') are now hashable.  (Fixed by Mark Dickinson;
     issue 7279(8).)

   * The ElementTree library, `xml.etree', no longer escapes ampersands
     and angle brackets when outputting an XML processing instruction
     (which looks like `<?xml-stylesheet href=”#style1”?>') or
     comment (which looks like `<!– comment –>').  (Patch by Neil
     Muller; issue 2746(9).)

   * The `readline()' method of *Note StringIO: 2df. objects now does
     nothing when a negative length is requested, as other file-like
     objects do.  (issue 7348(10)).

   * The *Note syslog: 16f. module will now use the value of
     `sys.argv[0]' as the identifier instead of the previous default
     value of `'python''.  (Changed by Sean Reifschneider; issue
     8451(11).)

   * The *Note tarfile: 171. module’s default error handling has
     changed, to no longer suppress fatal errors.  The default error
     level was previously 0, which meant that errors would only result
     in a message being written to the debug log, but because the debug
     log is not activated by default, these errors go unnoticed.  The
     default error level is now 1, which raises an exception if
     there’s an error.  (Changed by Lars Gustäbel; issue 7357(12).)

   * The *Note urlparse: 18a. module’s *Note urlsplit(): 26b. now
     handles unknown URL schemes in a fashion compliant with RFC
     3986(13): if the URL is of the form `"<something>://..."', the
     text before the `://' is treated as the scheme, even if it’s a
     made-up scheme that the module doesn’t know about.  This change
     may break code that worked around the old behaviour.  For example,
     Python 2.6.4 or 2.5 will return the following:

         >>> import urlparse
         >>> urlparse.urlsplit('invented://host/filename?query')
         ('invented', '', '//host/filename?query', '', '')

     Python 2.7 (and Python 2.6.5) will return:

         >>> import urlparse
         >>> urlparse.urlsplit('invented://host/filename?query')
         ('invented', 'host', '/filename?query', '', '')

     (Python 2.7 actually produces slightly different output, since it
     returns a named tuple instead of a standard tuple.)

For C extensions:

   * C extensions that use integer format codes with the `PyArg_Parse*'
     family of functions will now raise a *Note TypeError: 218.
     exception instead of triggering a *Note DeprecationWarning: 1bd.
     (issue 5080(14)).

   * Use the new *Note PyOS_string_to_double(): 2c0. function instead
     of the old *Note PyOS_ascii_strtod(): 2c1. and *Note
     PyOS_ascii_atof(): 2c2. functions, which are now deprecated.

For applications that embed Python:

   * The *Note PySys_SetArgvEx(): 2c3. function was added, letting
     applications close a security hole when the existing *Note
     PySys_SetArgv(): 2c4. function was used.  Check whether you’re
     calling *Note PySys_SetArgv(): 2c4. and carefully consider whether
     the application should be using *Note PySys_SetArgvEx(): 2c3. with
     `updatepath' set to false.

1.1.15 New Features Added to Python 2.7 Maintenance Releases
------------------------------------------------------------

New features may be added to Python 2.7 maintenance releases when the
situation genuinely calls for it. Any such additions must go through
the Python Enhancement Proposal process, and make a compelling case for
why they can’t be adequately addressed by either adding the new
feature solely to Python 3, or else by publishing it on the Python
Package Index.

In addition to the specific proposals listed below, there is a general
exemption allowing new `-3' warnings to be added in any Python 2.7
maintenance release.

* Menu:

* PEP 434; IDLE Enhancement Exception for All Branches: PEP 434 IDLE Enhancement Exception for All Branches.
* PEP 466; Network Security Enhancements for Python 2.7: PEP 466 Network Security Enhancements for Python 2 7.

     21306(3).)

   * OpenSSL 1.0.1g was upgraded in the official Windows installers
     published on python.org. (Contributed by Zachary Ware; issue
     21462(4).)

PEP 466(5) related features added in Python 2.7.8:

   * *Note hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac(): 2e4. was backported from Python 3 to
     make a hashing algorithm suitable for secure password storage
     broadly available to Python 2 applications. (Contributed by Alex
     Gaynor; issue 21304(6).)

   * OpenSSL 1.0.1h was upgraded for the official Windows installers
     published on python.org. (contributed by Zachary Ware in issue
     21671(7) for CVE-2014-0224)

PEP 466(8) related features added in Python 2.7.9:

   * Most of Python 3.4’s *Note ssl: 160. module was backported. This
     means *Note ssl: 160.  now supports Server Name Indication, TLS1.x
     settings, access to the platform certificate store, the *Note
     SSLContext: 2e5. class, and other features. (Contributed by Alex
     Gaynor and David Reid; issue 21308(9).)

     Refer to the “Version added: 2.7.9” notes in the module
     documentation for specific details.

   * *Note os.urandom(): 2e6. was changed to cache a file descriptor to
     `/dev/urandom' instead of reopening `/dev/urandom' on every call.
     (Contributed by Alex Gaynor; issue 21305(10).)

   * *Note hashlib.algorithms_guaranteed: 2e7. and *Note
     hashlib.algorithms_available: 2e8. were backported from Python 3
     to make it easier for Python 2 applications to select the
     strongest available hash algorithm. (Contributed by Alex Gaynor in

1.1.15.4 Bootstrapping pip By Default
.....................................

The new *Note ensurepip: c8. module (defined in PEP 453(1)) provides a
standard cross-platform mechanism to bootstrap the pip installer into
Python installations. The version of `pip' included with Python 2.7.9
is `pip' 1.5.6, and future 2.7.x maintenance releases will update the
bundled version to the latest version of `pip' that is available at the
time of creating the release candidate.

By default, the commands `pip', `pipX' and `pipX.Y' will be installed on
all platforms (where X.Y stands for the version of the Python
installation), along with the `pip' Python package and its dependencies.

For CPython *Note source builds on POSIX systems: 2eb, the `make
install' and `make altinstall' commands do not bootstrap `pip' by
default.  This behaviour can be controlled through configure options,
and overridden through Makefile options.

On Windows and Mac OS X, the CPython installers now default to
installing `pip' along with CPython itself (users may opt out of
installing it during the installation process). Window users will need
to opt in to the automatic `PATH' modifications to have `pip' available
from the command line by default, otherwise it can still be accessed
through the Python launcher for Windows as `py -m pip'.

As discussed in the PEP(2), platform packagers may choose not to install
these commands by default, as long as, when invoked, they provide clear
and simple directions on how to install them on that platform (usually
using the system package manager).

1.1.15.5 Documentation Changes
..............................

As part of this change, the *Note Installing Python Modules: 2ee. and
*Note Distributing Python Modules: 2ef. sections of the documentation
have been completely redesigned as short getting started and FAQ
documents. Most packaging documentation has now been moved out to the
Python Packaging Authority maintained Python Packaging User Guide(1)
and the documentation of the individual projects.

However, as this migration is currently still incomplete, the legacy
versions of those guides remaining available as *Note Installing Python
Modules (Legacy version): 2f0.  and *Note Distributing Python Modules
(Legacy version): 2f1.

1.1.15.6 PEP 476: Enabling certificate verification by default for stdlib http clients
......................................................................................

PEP 476(1) updated *Note httplib: ef. and modules which use it, such as
*Note urllib2: 189. and *Note xmlrpclib: 1aa, to now verify that the
server presents a certificate which is signed by a Certificate
Authority in the platform trust store and whose hostname matches the
hostname being requested by default, significantly improving security
for many applications. This change was made in the Python 2.7.9 release.

For applications which require the old previous behavior, they can pass
an alternate context:

    import urllib2
    import ssl

    # This disables all verification
    context = ssl._create_unverified_context()

    # This allows using a specific certificate for the host, which doesn't need
    # to be in the trust store
    context = ssl.create_default_context(cafile="/path/to/file.crt")

    urllib2.urlopen("https://invalid-cert", context=context)

...................................................................

PEP 493(1) provides additional migration tools to support a more
incremental infrastructure upgrade process for environments containing
applications and services relying on the historically permissive
processing of server certificates when establishing client HTTPS
connections.  These additions were made in the Python 2.7.12 release.

These tools are intended for use in cases where affected applications
and services can’t be modified to explicitly pass a more permissive
SSL context when establishing the connection.

For applications and services which can’t be modified at all, the new
`PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY' environment variable may be set to `0' to revert an
entire Python process back to the default permissive behaviour of
Python 2.7.8 and earlier.

For cases where the connection establishment code can’t be modified,
but the overall application can be, the new *Note
ssl._https_verify_certificates(): 2f4.  function can be used to adjust
the default behaviour at runtime.

1.2 What’s New in Python 2.6
==============================

Author: A.M. Kuchling (amk at amk.ca)

This article explains the new features in Python 2.6, released on
October 1 2008.  The release schedule is described in PEP 361(1).

The major theme of Python 2.6 is preparing the migration path to Python
3.0, a major redesign of the language.  Whenever possible, Python 2.6
incorporates new features and syntax from 3.0 while remaining
compatible with existing code by not removing older features or syntax.
When it’s not possible to do that, Python 2.6 tries to do what it
can, adding compatibility functions in a *Note future_builtins: db.
module and a *Note -3: 1cc. switch to warn about usages that will
become unsupported in 3.0.

Some significant new packages have been added to the standard library,
such as the *Note multiprocessing: 11a. and *Note json: fd. modules, but
there aren’t many new features that aren’t related to Python 3.0 in
some way.

Python 2.6 also sees a number of improvements and bugfixes throughout
the source.  A search through the change logs finds there were 259
patches applied and 612 bugs fixed between Python 2.5 and 2.6.  Both
figures are likely to be underestimates.

This article doesn’t attempt to provide a complete specification of
the new features, but instead provides a convenient overview.  For full
details, you should refer to the documentation for Python 2.6. If you
want to understand the rationale for the design and implementation,
refer to the PEP for a particular new feature.  Whenever possible,
“What’s New in Python” links to the bug/patch item for each
change.

1.2.1 Python 3.0
----------------

The development cycle for Python versions 2.6 and 3.0 was synchronized,
with the alpha and beta releases for both versions being made on the
same days.  The development of 3.0 has influenced many features in 2.6.

Python 3.0 is a far-ranging redesign of Python that breaks
compatibility with the 2.x series.  This means that existing Python
code will need some conversion in order to run on Python 3.0.  However,
not all the changes in 3.0 necessarily break compatibility.  In cases
where new features won’t cause existing code to break, they’ve been
backported to 2.6 and are described in this document in the appropriate
place.  Some of the 3.0-derived features are:

   * A *Note __complex__(): 2fa. method for converting objects to a
     complex number.

   * Alternate syntax for catching exceptions: `except TypeError as
     exc'.

   * The addition of *Note functools.reduce(): 2fb. as a synonym for
     the built-in *Note reduce(): 2fc. function.

Python 3.0 adds several new built-in functions and changes the
semantics of some existing builtins.  Functions that are new in 3.0
such as *Note bin(): 2fd. have simply been added to Python 2.6, but
existing builtins haven’t been changed; instead, the *Note
future_builtins: db.  module has versions with the new 3.0 semantics.
Code written to be compatible with 3.0 can do `from future_builtins
import hex, map' as necessary.

A new command-line switch, *Note -3: 1cc, enables warnings about
features that will be removed in Python 3.0.  You can run code with
this switch to see how much work will be necessary to port code to 3.0.
The value of this switch is available to Python code as the boolean
variable *Note sys.py3kwarning: 2fe, and to C extension code as
`Py_Py3kWarningFlag'.

1.2.2 Changes to the Development Process
----------------------------------------

While 2.6 was being developed, the Python development process underwent
two significant changes: we switched from SourceForge’s issue tracker
to a customized Roundup installation, and the documentation was
converted from LaTeX to reStructuredText.

1.2.2.1 New Issue Tracker: Roundup
..................................

For a long time, the Python developers had been growing increasingly
annoyed by SourceForge’s bug tracker.  SourceForge’s hosted solution
doesn’t permit much customization; for example, it wasn’t possible
to customize the life cycle of issues.

The infrastructure committee of the Python Software Foundation
therefore posted a call for issue trackers, asking volunteers to set up
different products and import some of the bugs and patches from
SourceForge.  Four different trackers were examined: Jira(1),
Launchpad(2), Roundup(3), and Trac(4).  The committee eventually
settled on Jira and Roundup as the two candidates.  Jira is a
commercial product that offers no-cost hosted instances to
free-software projects; Roundup is an open-source project that requires
volunteers to administer it and a server to host it.

After posting a call for volunteers, a new Roundup installation was set
up at <https://bugs.python.org>.  One installation of Roundup can host
multiple trackers, and this server now also hosts issue trackers for
Jython and for the Python web site.  It will surely find other uses in
the future.  Where possible, this edition of “What’s New in
Python” links to the bug/patch item for each change.

Hosting of the Python bug tracker is kindly provided by Upfront
Systems(5) of Stellenbosch, South Africa.  Martin von Loewis put a lot
of effort into importing existing bugs and patches from SourceForge;
his scripts for this import operation are at
<http://svn.python.org/view/tracker/importer/> and may be useful to
other projects wishing to move from SourceForge to Roundup.

File: python.info,  Node: New Documentation Format reStructuredText Using Sphinx,  Prev: New Issue Tracker Roundup,  Up: Changes to the Development Process

1.2.2.2 New Documentation Format: reStructuredText Using Sphinx
...............................................................

The Python documentation was written using LaTeX since the project
started around 1989.  In the 1980s and early 1990s, most documentation
was printed out for later study, not viewed online. LaTeX was widely
used because it provided attractive printed output while remaining
straightforward to write once the basic rules of the markup were
learned.

Today LaTeX is still used for writing publications destined for
printing, but the landscape for programming tools has shifted.  We no
longer print out reams of documentation; instead, we browse through it
online and HTML has become the most important format to support.
Unfortunately, converting LaTeX to HTML is fairly complicated and Fred
L. Drake Jr., the long-time Python documentation editor, spent a lot of
time maintaining the conversion process.  Occasionally people would
suggest converting the documentation into SGML and later XML, but
performing a good conversion is a major task and no one ever committed
the time required to finish the job.

During the 2.6 development cycle, Georg Brandl put a lot of effort into
building a new toolchain for processing the documentation.  The
resulting package is called Sphinx, and is available from
<http://sphinx-doc.org/>.

Sphinx concentrates on HTML output, producing attractively styled and
modern HTML; printed output is still supported through conversion to
LaTeX.  The input format is reStructuredText, a markup syntax
supporting custom extensions and directives that is commonly used in
the Python community.

Sphinx is a standalone package that can be used for writing, and almost
two dozen other projects (listed on the Sphinx web site(1)) have
adopted Sphinx as their documentation tool.

1.2.3 PEP 343: The ‘with’ statement
---------------------------------------

The previous version, Python 2.5, added the ‘*Note with: 1c1.’
statement as an optional feature, to be enabled by a `from __future__
import with_statement' directive.  In 2.6 the statement no longer needs
to be specially enabled; this means that *Note with: 1c1. is now always
a keyword.  The rest of this section is a copy of the corresponding
section from the “What’s New in Python 2.5” document; if you’re
familiar with the ‘*Note with: 1c1.’ statement from Python 2.5, you
can skip this section.

The ‘*Note with: 1c1.’ statement clarifies code that previously
would use `try...finally' blocks to ensure that clean-up code is
executed.  In this section, I’ll discuss the statement as it will
commonly be used.  In the next section, I’ll examine the
implementation details and show how to write objects for use with this
statement.

The ‘*Note with: 1c1.’ statement is a control-flow structure whose
basic structure is:

    with expression [as variable]:
        with-block

The expression is evaluated, and it should result in an object that
supports the context management protocol (that is, has *Note
__enter__(): 1ff. and *Note __exit__(): 200.  methods).

The object’s *Note __enter__(): 1ff. is called before `with-block' is
executed and therefore can run set-up code. It also may return a value
that is bound to the name `variable', if given.  (Note carefully that
`variable' is `not' assigned the result of `expression'.)

After execution of the `with-block' is finished, the object’s *Note
__exit__(): 200.  method is called, even if the block raised an
exception, and can therefore run clean-up code.

Some standard Python objects now support the context management
protocol and can be used with the ‘*Note with: 1c1.’ statement.
File objects are one example:

    with open('/etc/passwd', 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            print line
            ... more processing code ...

After this statement has executed, the file object in `f' will have been
automatically closed, even if the *Note for: 303. loop raised an
exception part- way through the block.

     Note: In this case, `f' is the same object created by *Note
     open(): 2d9, because `file.__enter__()' returns `self'.

The *Note threading: 179. module’s locks and condition variables
also support the ‘*Note with: 1c1.’ statement:

    lock = threading.Lock()
    with lock:
        # Critical section of code
        ...

The lock is acquired before the block is executed and always released
once  the block is complete.

The `localcontext()' function in the *Note decimal: 80. module makes it
easy to save and restore the current decimal context, which
encapsulates the desired precision and rounding characteristics for
computations:

    from decimal import Decimal, Context, localcontext

    # Displays with default precision of 28 digits
    v = Decimal('578')
    print v.sqrt()

    with localcontext(Context(prec=16)):
        # All code in this block uses a precision of 16 digits.
        # The original context is restored on exiting the block.
        print v.sqrt()

* Writing Context Managers::
* The contextlib module::


File: python.info,  Node: Writing Context Managers,  Next: The contextlib module,  Up: PEP 343 The ‘with’ statement

1.2.3.1 Writing Context Managers
................................

Under the hood, the ‘*Note with: 1c1.’ statement is fairly
complicated. Most people will only use ‘*Note with: 1c1.’ in
company with existing objects and don’t need to know these details,
so you can skip the rest of this section if you like.  Authors of new
objects will need to understand the details of the underlying
implementation and should keep reading.

A high-level explanation of the context management protocol is:

   * The expression is evaluated and should result in an object called
     a “context manager”.  The context manager must have *Note
     __enter__(): 1ff. and *Note __exit__(): 200.  methods.

   * The context manager’s *Note __enter__(): 1ff. method is called.
     The value returned is assigned to `VAR'.  If no `as VAR' clause is
     present, the value is simply discarded.

   * The code in `BLOCK' is executed.

   * If `BLOCK' raises an exception, the context manager’s *Note
     __exit__(): 200. method is called with three arguments, the
     exception details (`type, value, traceback', the same values
     returned by *Note sys.exc_info(): 306, which can also be `None' if
     no exception occurred).  The method’s return value controls
     whether an exception is re-raised: any false value re-raises the
     exception, and `True' will result in suppressing it.  You’ll
     only rarely want to suppress the exception, because if you do the
     author of the code containing the ‘*Note with: 1c1.’ statement
     will never realize anything went wrong.

   * If `BLOCK' didn’t raise an exception,  the *Note __exit__():
     200. method is still called, but `type', `value', and `traceback'
     are all `None'.

Let’s think through an example.  I won’t present detailed code but
will only sketch the methods necessary for a database that supports
transactions.

(For people unfamiliar with database terminology: a set of changes to
the database are grouped into a transaction.  Transactions can be
either committed, meaning that all the changes are written into the
database, or rolled back, meaning that the changes are all discarded
and the database is unchanged.  See any database textbook for more
information.)

Let’s assume there’s an object representing a database connection.
Our goal will be to let the user write code like this:

    db_connection = DatabaseConnection()
    with db_connection as cursor:
        cursor.execute('insert into ...')
        cursor.execute('delete from ...')
        # ... more operations ...

The transaction should be committed if the code in the block runs
flawlessly or rolled back if there’s an exception. Here’s the basic
interface for `DatabaseConnection' that I’ll assume:

    class DatabaseConnection:
        # Database interface
        def cursor(self):
            "Returns a cursor object and starts a new transaction"
        def commit(self):
            "Commits current transaction"
        def rollback(self):
            "Rolls back current transaction"

The *Note __enter__(): 1ff. method is pretty easy, having only to start
a new transaction.  For this application the resulting cursor object
would be a useful result, so the method will return it.  The user can
then add `as cursor' to their ‘*Note with: 1c1.’ statement to bind
the cursor to a variable name.

    class DatabaseConnection:
        ...
        def __enter__(self):
            # Code to start a new transaction
            cursor = self.cursor()
            return cursor

The *Note __exit__(): 200. method is the most complicated because
it’s where most of the work has to be done.  The method has to check
if an exception occurred.  If there was no exception, the transaction
is committed.  The transaction is rolled back if there was an exception.

In the code below, execution will just fall off the end of the function,
returning the default value of `None'.  `None' is false, so the
exception will be re-raised automatically.  If you wished, you could be
more explicit and add a *Note return: 307. statement at the marked
location.

    class DatabaseConnection:
        ...
        def __exit__(self, type, value, tb):
            if tb is None:
                # No exception, so commit
                self.commit()
            else:
                # Exception occurred, so rollback.
                self.rollback()
                # return False

1.2.3.2 The contextlib module
.............................

The *Note contextlib: 6e. module provides some functions and a
decorator that are useful when writing objects for use with the
‘*Note with: 1c1.’ statement.

The decorator is called `contextmanager()', and lets you write a single
generator function instead of defining a new class.  The generator
should yield exactly one value.  The code up to the *Note yield: 30a.
will be executed as the *Note __enter__(): 1ff. method, and the value
yielded will be the method’s return value that will get bound to the
variable in the ‘*Note with: 1c1.’ statement’s *Note as: 30b.
clause, if any.  The code after the *Note yield: 30a. will be executed
in the *Note __exit__(): 200. method.  Any exception raised in the
block will be raised by the *Note yield: 30a. statement.

Using this decorator, our database example from the previous section
could be written as:

    from contextlib import contextmanager

    @contextmanager
    def db_transaction(connection):
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        try:
            yield cursor
        except:
            connection.rollback()
            raise
        else:
            connection.commit()

    db = DatabaseConnection()
    with db_transaction(db) as cursor:
        ...

The *Note contextlib: 6e. module also has a `nested(mgr1, mgr2, ...)'
function that combines a number of context managers so you don’t need
to write nested ‘*Note with: 1c1.’ statements.  In this example,
the single ‘*Note with: 1c1.’ statement both starts a database
transaction and acquires a thread lock:

    lock = threading.Lock()
    with nested (db_transaction(db), lock) as (cursor, locked):
        ...

Finally, the `closing()' function returns its argument so that it can be
bound to a variable, and calls the argument’s `.close()' method at
the end of the block.

    import urllib, sys
    from contextlib import closing

    with closing(urllib.urlopen('http://www.yahoo.com')) as f:
        for line in f:
            sys.stdout.write(line)

1.2.4 PEP 366: Explicit Relative Imports From a Main Module
-----------------------------------------------------------

Python’s *Note -m: 30e. switch allows running a module as a script.
When you ran a module that was located inside a package, relative
imports didn’t work correctly.

The fix for Python 2.6 adds a `__package__' attribute to modules.  When
this attribute is present, relative imports will be relative to the
value of this attribute instead of the `__name__' attribute.

PEP 302-style importers can then set `__package__' as necessary.  The
*Note runpy: 14b. module that implements the *Note -m: 30e. switch now
does this, so relative imports will now work correctly in scripts
running from inside a package.

1.2.5 PEP 370: Per-user `site-packages' Directory
-------------------------------------------------

When you run Python, the module search path `sys.path' usually includes
a directory whose path ends in `"site-packages"'.  This directory is
intended to hold locally-installed packages available to all users
using a machine or a particular site installation.

Python 2.6 introduces a convention for user-specific site directories.
The directory varies depending on the platform:

   * Unix and Mac OS X: `~/.local/'

   * Windows: `%APPDATA%/Python'

Within this directory, there will be version-specific subdirectories,
such as `lib/python2.6/site-packages' on Unix/Mac OS and
`Python26/site-packages' on Windows.

If you don’t like the default directory, it can be overridden by an
environment variable.  *Note PYTHONUSERBASE: 311. sets the root
directory used for all Python versions supporting this feature.  On
Windows, the directory for application-specific data can be changed by
setting the `APPDATA' environment variable.  You can also modify the

1.2.6 PEP 371: The `multiprocessing' Package
--------------------------------------------

The new *Note multiprocessing: 11a. package lets Python programs create
new processes that will perform a computation and return a result to the
parent.  The parent and child processes can communicate using queues
and pipes, synchronize their operations using locks and semaphores, and
can share simple arrays of data.

The *Note multiprocessing: 11a. module started out as an exact
emulation of the *Note threading: 179. module using processes instead
of threads.  That goal was discarded along the path to Python 2.6, but
the general approach of the module is still similar.  The fundamental
class is the `Process', which is passed a callable object and a
collection of arguments.  The `start()' method sets the callable
running in a subprocess, after which you can call the `is_alive()'
method to check whether the subprocess is still running and the
`join()' method to wait for the process to exit.

Here’s a simple example where the subprocess will calculate a
factorial.  The function doing the calculation is written strangely so
that it takes significantly longer when the input argument is a
multiple of 4.

    import time
    from multiprocessing import Process, Queue


    def factorial(queue, N):
        "Compute a factorial."
        # If N is a multiple of 4, this function will take much longer.
        if (N % 4) == 0:
            time.sleep(.05 * N/4)

        # Calculate the result
        fact = 1L
        for i in range(1, N+1):
            fact = fact * i

        # Put the result on the queue
        queue.put(fact)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        queue = Queue()

        N = 5

        p = Process(target=factorial, args=(queue, N))
        p.start()
        p.join()

        result = queue.get()
        print 'Factorial', N, '=', result

A *Note Queue: 316. is used to communicate the result of the factorial.
The *Note Queue: 316. object is stored in a global variable.  The child
process will use the value of the variable when the child was created;
because it’s a *Note Queue: 316, parent and child can use the object
to communicate.  (If the parent were to change the value of the global
variable, the child’s value would be unaffected, and vice versa.)

Two other classes, `Pool' and `Manager', provide higher-level
interfaces.  `Pool' will create a fixed number of worker processes, and
requests can then be distributed to the workers by calling *Note
apply(): 317. or `apply_async()' to add a single request, and *Note
map(): 318. or `map_async()' to add a number of requests.  The
following code uses a `Pool' to spread requests across 5 worker
processes and retrieve a list of results:

    from multiprocessing import Pool

    def factorial(N, dictionary):
        "Compute a factorial."
        ...
    p = Pool(5)
    result = p.map(factorial, range(1, 1000, 10))
    for v in result:
        print v

This produces the following output:

    1
    39916800
    51090942171709440000
    8222838654177922817725562880000000
    33452526613163807108170062053440751665152000000000
    ...

The other high-level interface, the `Manager' class, creates a separate
server process that can hold master copies of Python data structures.
Other processes can then access and modify these data structures using
proxy objects.  The following example creates a shared dictionary by
calling the *Note dict(): 319. method; the worker processes then insert
values into the dictionary.  (Locking is not done for you
automatically, which doesn’t matter in this example.  `Manager'’s
methods also include `Lock()', `RLock()', and `Semaphore()' to create
shared locks.)

    import time
    from multiprocessing import Pool, Manager

    def factorial(N, dictionary):
        "Compute a factorial."
        # Calculate the result
        fact = 1L
        for i in range(1, N+1):
            fact = fact * i

        # Store result in dictionary
        dictionary[N] = fact

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        p = Pool(5)
        mgr = Manager()
        d = mgr.dict()         # Create shared dictionary

        # Run tasks using the pool
        for N in range(1, 1000, 10):
            p.apply_async(factorial, (N, d))

        # Mark pool as closed -- no more tasks can be added.
        p.close()

        # Wait for tasks to exit
        p.join()

        # Output results
        for k, v in sorted(d.items()):
            print k, v

This will produce the output:

    1 1
    11 39916800
    21 51090942171709440000
    31 8222838654177922817725562880000000

1.2.7 PEP 3101: Advanced String Formatting
------------------------------------------

In Python 3.0, the `%' operator is supplemented by a more powerful
string formatting method, *Note format(): 1ef.  Support for the *Note
str.format(): 1d4. method has been backported to Python 2.6.

In 2.6, both 8-bit and Unicode strings have a `.format()' method that
treats the string as a template and takes the arguments to be formatted.
The formatting template uses curly brackets (`{', `}') as special
characters:

    >>> # Substitute positional argument 0 into the string.
    >>> "User ID: {0}".format("root")
    'User ID: root'
    >>> # Use the named keyword arguments
    >>> "User ID: {uid}   Last seen: {last_login}".format(
    ...    uid="root",
    ...    last_login = "5 Mar 2008 07:20")
    'User ID: root   Last seen: 5 Mar 2008 07:20'

Curly brackets can be escaped by doubling them:

    >>> "Empty dict: {{}}".format()
    "Empty dict: {}"

Field names can be integers indicating positional arguments, such as
`{0}', `{1}', etc. or names of keyword arguments.  You can also supply
compound field names that read attributes or access dictionary keys:

    >>> import sys
    >>> print 'Platform: {0.platform}\nPython version: {0.version}'.format(sys)
    Platform: darwin
    Python version: 2.6a1+ (trunk:61261M, Mar  5 2008, 20:29:41)
    [GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 5367)]'

    >>> import mimetypes
    >>> 'Content-type: {0[.mp4]}'.format(mimetypes.types_map)
    'Content-type: video/mp4'

Note that when using dictionary-style notation such as `[.mp4]', you
don’t need to put any quotation marks around the string; it will look
up the value using `.mp4' as the key.  Strings beginning with a number
will be converted to an integer.  You can’t write more complicated
expressions inside a format string.

So far we’ve shown how to specify which field to substitute into the
resulting string.  The precise formatting used is also controllable by
adding a colon followed by a format specifier.  For example:

    >>> # Field 0: left justify, pad to 15 characters
    >>> # Field 1: right justify, pad to 6 characters
    >>> fmt = '{0:15} ${1:>6}'
    >>> fmt.format('Registration', 35)
    'Registration    $    35'
    >>> fmt.format('Tutorial', 50)
    'Tutorial        $    50'
    >>> fmt.format('Banquet', 125)
    'Banquet         $   125'

Format specifiers can reference other fields through nesting:

    >>> fmt = '{0:{1}}'
    >>> width = 15
    >>> fmt.format('Invoice #1234', width)
    'Invoice #1234  '
    >>> width = 35
    >>> fmt.format('Invoice #1234', width)
    'Invoice #1234                      '

The alignment of a field within the desired width can be specified:

Character            Effect
---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
< (default)          Left-align
>                    Right-align
^                    Center
=                    (For numeric types only) Pad after the sign.

Format specifiers can also include a presentation type, which controls
how the value is formatted.  For example, floating-point numbers can be
formatted as a general number or in exponential notation:

    >>> '{0:g}'.format(3.75)
    '3.75'
    >>> '{0:e}'.format(3.75)
    '3.750000e+00'

A variety of presentation types are available.  Consult the 2.6
documentation for a *Note complete list: 31c.; here’s a sample:

`b'       Binary. Outputs the number in base 2.
`c'       Character. Converts the integer to the corresponding Unicode character
          before printing.
`d'       Decimal Integer. Outputs the number in base 10.
`o'       Octal format. Outputs the number in base 8.
`x'       Hex format. Outputs the number in base 16, using lower-case letters for the
          digits above 9.
`e'       Exponent notation. Prints the number in scientific notation using the
          letter ‘e’ to indicate the exponent.
`g'       General format. This prints the number as a fixed-point number, unless the
          number is too large, in which case it switches to ‘e’ exponent notation.
`n'       Number. This is the same as ‘g’ (for floats) or ‘d’ (for integers),
          except that it uses the current locale setting to insert the appropriate
          number separator characters.
`%'       Percentage. Multiplies the number by 100 and displays in fixed (‘f’)
          format, followed by a percent sign.

Classes and types can define a `__format__()' method to control how
they’re formatted.  It receives a single argument, the format
specifier:

    def __format__(self, format_spec):
        if isinstance(format_spec, unicode):
            return unicode(str(self))
        else:
            return str(self)

There’s also a *Note format(): 1ef. builtin that will format a single
value.  It calls the type’s `__format__()' method with the provided
specifier:

    >>> format(75.6564, '.2f')
    '75.66'

1.2.8 PEP 3105: `print' As a Function
-------------------------------------

The `print' statement becomes the *Note print(): 31f. function in
Python 3.0.  Making *Note print(): 31f. a function makes it possible to
replace the function by doing `def print(...)' or importing a new
function from somewhere else.

Python 2.6 has a `__future__' import that removes `print' as language
syntax, letting you use the functional form instead.  For example:

    >>> from __future__ import print_function
    >>> print('# of entries', len(dictionary), file=sys.stderr)

The signature of the new function is:

    def print(*args, sep=' ', end='\n', file=None)

The parameters are:

        * `args': positional arguments whose values will be printed out.

        * `sep': the separator, which will be printed between arguments.

        * `end': the ending text, which will be printed after all of the
          arguments have been output.

        * `file': the file object to which the output will be sent.
